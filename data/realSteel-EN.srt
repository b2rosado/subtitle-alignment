1
00:03:11,734 --> 00:03:13,109
Hang on, hang on, hang on.

2
00:03:13,277 --> 00:03:15,403
Come on.

3
00:03:15,571 --> 00:03:17,864
- Yeah? - Where are you, Charlie?

4
00:03:18,032 --> 00:03:20,283
More importantly, where is my money?

5
00:03:20,618 --> 00:03:21,659
- You're into me for 30 grand. - All right, all right.

6
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:23,703
Jack, Jack, Jack, I'm going to pay you.

7
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:25,705
This ain't Jack! It's Bill Panner.

8
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:27,415
You owe Jack money, too?

9
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:29,417
Charlie, you pay me first!

10
00:03:29,585 --> 00:03:31,711
Bill, hey, no, we're good, buddy.

11
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:33,213
I got your money. It's right here in my hand.

12
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:38,051
So why don't we meet up on the...>>

13
00:03:41,013 --> 00:03:42,514
- Charlie, your phone's going screwy. - Bill?

14
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:43,890
- Hello? - I'm losing you, Bill.

15
00:03:44,058 --> 00:03:46,643
Wait, Charlie, I can't hear what you're saying.

16
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:52,148
Hey, mister. Is that Ambush?

17
00:03:52,316 --> 00:03:55,610
- Uh, yeah. - Can we see him?

18
00:03:57,196 --> 00:03:59,239
- You want to see him? - Yeah.

19
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:03,159
All right, give me... Give me a minute.

20
00:04:07,957 --> 00:04:10,458
This...>>

21
00:04:10,626 --> 00:04:13,419
...is Ambush. Wakey, wakey.

22
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:36,526
- What robot is he fighting? - Actually, he's going to fight...>>

23
00:04:36,694 --> 00:04:38,361
Whoa, little lady. What are you doing?

24
00:04:38,529 --> 00:04:41,573
- Can we get a picture with him? - Sure. For five dollars.

25
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,867
You want five dollars? Seriously?

26
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:46,536
No, I want five dollars immediately.

27
00:04:46,704 --> 00:04:48,246
Come on, guys.

28
00:04:48,414 --> 00:04:49,956
Hey, hey.

29
00:04:50,124 --> 00:04:51,541
All right, all right, I'm kidding.

30
00:04:51,709 --> 00:04:53,251
- Three bucks. - Whatever.

31
00:04:53,419 --> 00:04:55,920
- How about $2.50? - You suck!

32
00:04:57,173 --> 00:04:59,007
All right.

33
00:04:59,175 --> 00:05:02,552
It's going to be one of those towns, huh?

34
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,679
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen,>>

35
00:05:04,847 --> 00:05:07,140
to the 2020 San Leandro County Fair.

36
00:05:07,308 --> 00:05:08,266
- Yah! - Please take your seats.

37
00:05:08,434 --> 00:05:11,227
We're almost ready to get this thing started.

38
00:05:13,397 --> 00:05:15,899
I was told my bot was fighting an 800-pound steer.

39
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:18,568
Hey, hey! That is not 800 pounds, knucklehead.

40
00:05:18,736 --> 00:05:22,030
Charlie "the Can Do Kid" Kenton.

41
00:05:22,198 --> 00:05:23,781
Time has not been good to you, my friend.

42
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:25,617
Ricky, we got a problem here. A big problem.

43
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:28,453
Whoa, hey, slow down there, hoss.

44
00:05:28,621 --> 00:05:30,330
Come on, last time I saw you,>>

45
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:33,082
you were staring up at the ceiling at the Sam Houston Center>>

46
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,543
with the taste of my right cross all over your face.

47
00:05:35,711 --> 00:05:37,712
Pow!

48
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,006
- Are we good to go here? - Yeah.

49
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:43,593
We agreed that my boxer would fight an 800-pound steer for three grand.

50
00:05:43,761 --> 00:05:45,386
- Am I right? - Yes, sir. We did.

51
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:47,513
- That bull is, like, 2,000 pounds. - Right, OK.

52
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:49,390
Well, Charlie, I'll tell you something.

53
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:52,560
Your bot don't fight, you don't get paid! Whoo!

54
00:05:52,728 --> 00:05:54,437
How about that?

55
00:05:55,481 --> 00:05:57,982
Get the hell out of here.

56
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:00,193
All right, all right.

57
00:06:01,487 --> 00:06:02,904
Why don't we make this more interesting?

58
00:06:03,072 --> 00:06:04,781
My bot against your bull, straight up.

59
00:06:04,949 --> 00:06:06,741
- How much? - Twenty grand, winner takes all.

60
00:06:06,909 --> 00:06:09,702
- You got 20 grand, Charlie? - In a safe in my truck.

61
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,250
All right, Charlie. I'll tell you what,>>

62
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:18,670
twenty grand it is, but if you lose and you welch,>>

63
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:21,506
I'm gonna come after you and beat you to within an inch of your life.

64
00:06:21,674 --> 00:06:23,841
And you know that I can do that because I already done it!

65
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:25,468
What's the problem with you, man? In life you get too close,>>

66
00:06:25,636 --> 00:06:27,595
in the ring you stand back like a girl. Just shake.

67
00:06:27,763 --> 00:06:29,305
All right, Charlie.

68
00:06:29,473 --> 00:06:31,015
Shake and pow! Just like that once again.

69
00:06:31,183 --> 00:06:33,017
You want to dance again? You wanna dance?

70
00:06:33,185 --> 00:06:34,602
Come on, cheer for this guy. Give him some luck.

71
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:36,562
He needs some luck, y'all. Yahoo! Let's get going!

72
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:40,191
Don't touch that bull.

73
00:06:40,359 --> 00:06:42,860
Ladies and gentlemen, I got to ask,>>

74
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:45,280
do we have any fans of robot boxing here today?

75
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:50,243
Now, listen, friends, I understand,>>

76
00:06:50,411 --> 00:06:54,163
we can't all afford to go all the way over there to Dallas>>

77
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:59,210
and pay $300 for one of those World Robot Boxing League fights. I get it.

78
00:06:59,378 --> 00:07:02,463
So, I decided that I would bring a robot boxing match>>

79
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:06,050
right here to our little fair here in San Leandro.

80
00:07:06,218 --> 00:07:08,136
How about that?

81
00:07:08,304 --> 00:07:09,804
All right.

82
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:13,891
Ladies and gentlemen, I introduce to you,>>

83
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:18,771
- Ambush! - Let's do it!

84
00:07:21,317 --> 00:07:22,900
All right, big fella.

85
00:07:26,697 --> 00:07:28,364
Whoo-hoo!

86
00:07:28,532 --> 00:07:30,325
He's a big fella, ain't he?

87
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:33,995
Take a turn. Let them see how beautiful you are.

88
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:37,248
Yeah.

89
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:39,751
Show them some power.

90
00:07:41,003 --> 00:07:43,629
Look at that. He's getting all kung fu-y on us.

91
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:47,133
- Yeah! - Yeah, big fella.

92
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:49,552
Ambush's opponent today, he's last year's runner-up>>

93
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,763
in the baddest of the bulls competition,>>

94
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:57,393
ladies and gentlemen, Black Thunder!

95
00:07:59,897 --> 00:08:01,522
- Let's get it on! - Let's get this thing started.

96
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:06,652
Is that all you got?

97
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:10,698
Yeah, brother. Bring it on.

98
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:22,210
Take him, take him.

99
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:27,131
Ambush lays the smackdown on that prime beef.

100
00:08:27,299 --> 00:08:28,424
Woo woo!

101
00:08:33,097 --> 00:08:35,181
I got more for you, big fella. We're just getting started.

102
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:40,144
OK. Jump, now!

103
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:45,066
Boo-yah!

104
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:49,404
- Dang it! - Ambush, decks>>

105
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:51,447
Black Thunder but when you mess with the bull,>>

106
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:53,282
you're going to get the horns.

107
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:57,578
You like that. I can tell.

108
00:08:57,746 --> 00:08:59,539
You like that.

109
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:00,832
Jeez! Turn around!

110
00:09:05,254 --> 00:09:07,713
Ricky! Ricky, stop this thing!

111
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:19,392
Come on, come on. We're still in this thing.

112
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,852
We're still in this. Just hop. Hop.

113
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:23,396
That's it. Come on.

114
00:09:27,526 --> 00:09:29,944
Ricky, enough! Enough!

115
00:09:30,112 --> 00:09:33,239
I can't hear you over the sound of your robot being destroyed.

116
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,493
Kill! Kill! Kill!

117
00:09:37,661 --> 00:09:39,454
All right, come on. Get up.

118
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:42,874
Get up. Come on!

119
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:45,960
No!

120
00:09:50,549 --> 00:09:53,217
C'mon. No, no, no!

121
00:09:59,558 --> 00:10:01,100
Ladies and gentlemen, let's hear it>>

122
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:05,730
for our warriors out here today at the 2020 San Leandro County Fair.

123
00:10:05,898 --> 00:10:07,815
Now, thank you all for coming out,>>

124
00:10:07,983 --> 00:10:11,235
and we'll see you next time, because there will be one.

125
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:13,696
Hey, hey! Give me that leg.

126
00:10:13,864 --> 00:10:15,698
Sure. For five dollars.

127
00:10:15,866 --> 00:10:17,533
Boo-yah!

128
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:20,286
Whoo! All right!

129
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:24,540
That was ridonculous fun, now wasn't it, ladies and gentlemen?

130
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:28,669
I'm going to come by for my money, Charlie boy. You best have it.

131
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:30,838
- Everybody say "hey!" - Hey!

132
00:10:31,006 --> 00:10:34,717
- Everybody say "ho!" - Ho!

133
00:10:34,885 --> 00:10:38,137
How about that? How you doing there, little robot?

134
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:57,240
My keys, damn it.

135
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,408
One more step and I'll drop you like your girlfriend.

136
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:00,826
Charlie, relax.

137
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:02,537
I'm not paying you. That was a bogus fight.

138
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:04,789
- It cost me my last robot. - Just listen to us.

139
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:08,417
- Do you recall Caroline Fallon? - She's my ex-girlfriend.

140
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:11,087
I haven't seen her in like ten years. What does she want?

141
00:11:11,255 --> 00:11:14,632
- Nothing. She died. - Do you recall Max Kenton?

142
00:11:16,468 --> 00:11:18,094
He's my son. He's got to be like nine.

143
00:11:18,262 --> 00:11:19,929
- Eleven. - Eleven. OK.

144
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:22,848
Is he dead, too?

145
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:25,851
No, he's fine. That's why we're here.

146
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:55,798
This court is convened to address the custodial status>>

147
00:11:55,966 --> 00:11:59,010
of one Max Kenton, age 11.

148
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:01,095
Mother, Caroline Fallon, deceased.

149
00:12:01,263 --> 00:12:02,888
Father, Charles Kenton.

150
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:05,099
Debra Fallon Barnes, you're the boy's aunt.

151
00:12:05,267 --> 00:12:08,728
Yes. As I've already told you,>>

152
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:10,855
my husband, Marvin, is wealthy,>>

153
00:12:11,023 --> 00:12:14,191
and we can more than provide for Max.

154
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:17,987
I appreciate that, but per Texas state law, without a written will>>

155
00:12:18,155 --> 00:12:19,739
next of kin retains custody.

156
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:22,950
Charles Kenton, who is aware of this custody hearing,>>

157
00:12:23,118 --> 00:12:24,619
and we are expecting him...>>

158
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:27,288
No, I need a new robot now.

159
00:12:27,456 --> 00:12:29,624
I had a big fight for Ambush next Saturday.

160
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,292
I got to show up with something.

161
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,544
Noisy Boy is for sale?

162
00:12:33,712 --> 00:12:37,214
In his day, Noisy Boy was a killer. How much?

163
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:39,550
That's a good deal. What's wrong with him?

164
00:12:39,718 --> 00:12:41,636
I can live with that.

165
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:44,180
Well, I don't have it have it.

166
00:12:44,348 --> 00:12:47,058
Charles Kenton waived all of his rights to custody>>

167
00:12:47,225 --> 00:12:51,062
right after the boy was born. I can more than provide for Max.

168
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:53,272
Whoa.

169
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,690
Please be Charles Kenton.

170
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:58,402
Uh... Charlie, yeah.

171
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:01,489
I'm here to sign some paper>>

172
00:13:01,657 --> 00:13:04,950
that releases my rights to the custody of my son.

173
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:07,036
That's why I'm here. Do I need to be here?

174
00:13:07,204 --> 00:13:09,455
Charlie.

175
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:12,166
Do you even remember me?

176
00:13:12,334 --> 00:13:14,877
- Debra, Caroline's sister. - Yeah, sure, Debra. How are you?

177
00:13:15,045 --> 00:13:16,045
- Mr. Kenton. - Yeah.

178
00:13:16,213 --> 00:13:17,254
Please take a seat.

179
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:22,510
Your Honor, may I please go and see my nephew now?

180
00:13:22,678 --> 00:13:24,011
Yes, you may.

181
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:26,389
- How about you, Mr. Kenton? - What?

182
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:28,557
You can spend some time with him, if you'd like.

183
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:30,351
- With the kid? - Yeah, the kid.

184
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:32,311
- Max. Your son? - All right, all right.

185
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:35,231
You've been working with those robots for so long, you've become one.

186
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:38,651
Honey, you wait right here. I'm going to be back.

187
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:41,445
You take all the time you need, sweetheart.

188
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:50,079
Your Honor, I'd like to, at this juncture,>>

189
00:13:50,247 --> 00:13:52,957
step out and call my attorney, if that's all right.

190
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:54,417
Please.

191
00:13:57,796 --> 00:14:00,548
Come on. Come on.

192
00:14:00,716 --> 00:14:02,591
There you are.

193
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:05,177
He'll be in a foster home.

194
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:08,180
No, they find good families.

195
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:10,015
Young, energetic. Yeah.

196
00:14:11,268 --> 00:14:14,228
Thanks, Michael. I will. OK.

197
00:14:14,396 --> 00:14:15,563
Oh, hey.

198
00:14:15,731 --> 00:14:17,690
Hey, um...>>

199
00:14:17,858 --> 00:14:20,901
- Marvin Barnes. I'm Debra's husband. - Right, yeah.

200
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:23,863
You know, Debra really wants to adopt Max.

201
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:26,449
And...>>

202
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:29,618
- I'm up for it, but... - Seventy-five grand.

203
00:14:30,454 --> 00:14:31,746
$75,000?

204
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:35,124
- You're serious? - Mm-hmm.

205
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,461
The thing is...>>

206
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:41,088
...we're supposed to go to Italy this summer>>

207
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:44,925
with my oldest friend and his wife. Two months in Tuscany and all over.

208
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:46,594
Just the four of you. Sounds nice.

209
00:14:46,762 --> 00:14:49,972
We'll be back in New York by the end of August.

210
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:53,267
In August. A hundred.

211
00:14:53,435 --> 00:14:55,352
- $100,000? - You heard me.

212
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,772
- You're crazy. - Not nearly as crazy as your wife>>

213
00:14:57,939 --> 00:15:01,192
if you tell her I just signed over that kid to the state of Texas.

214
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:04,987
The way I see it, there's a real way everyone gets what they want here.

215
00:15:05,155 --> 00:15:07,281
So here's what you're going to do.

216
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:10,326
You're going to tell your wife I'll only sign over custody to her>>

217
00:15:10,494 --> 00:15:12,787
if I get to spend the summer with the kid first.

218
00:15:12,954 --> 00:15:15,372
Just tell her how guilty she made me feel>>

219
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:19,543
for being such a terrible absentee dad how I want to make good with junior,>>

220
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:21,712
a little fatherly bonding, whatnot.

221
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:26,175
She'll buy it, you get to be the hero, and everybody wins.

222
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:32,890
OK. But not a word about the money to Debra, you understand?

223
00:15:34,059 --> 00:15:35,267
I understand.

224
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:37,812
I'll give you 50 grand tonight when we drop off Max>>

225
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:39,980
and the other 50 when we get back in August>>

226
00:15:40,148 --> 00:15:42,233
and you deliver him to us in New York.

227
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,610
Pleasure doing business with you.

228
00:15:47,322 --> 00:15:49,698
Your Honor, I'm really happy we all took the time>>

229
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:51,408
to make the best decision for everyone.

230
00:15:54,663 --> 00:15:56,330
- Happy? - Yeah, it's me.

231
00:15:56,498 --> 00:15:59,500
I'm buying Noisy Boy. I got the money.

232
00:15:59,668 --> 00:16:02,837
Take him to Tallet's Gym and I'll meet you there.

233
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:18,644
Hello?

234
00:16:19,855 --> 00:16:21,272
Bailey?

235
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:23,065
Some guy is here with the robot you're buying,>>

236
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:24,358
and I gotta tell ya, Charlie,>>

237
00:16:24,526 --> 00:16:27,278
- it smells like disaster to me. - Nice to see you, too, Bailey.

238
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:30,406
- Might I also say how cute you look. - Give it up, Charlie.

239
00:16:30,574 --> 00:16:32,491
God, I need a shower. You want to take a shower?

240
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:35,536
- Come on. - Let me make something clear.

241
00:16:35,704 --> 00:16:38,539
A creepy dude with a robot in a box>>

242
00:16:38,707 --> 00:16:41,083
has been sitting outside my gym for two hours.

243
00:16:41,251 --> 00:16:43,377
Now, putting aside the fact that you're doing>>

244
00:16:43,545 --> 00:16:46,130
what I'm guessing is a black market deal on my doorstep,>>

245
00:16:46,298 --> 00:16:48,215
how are you gonna pay him when Ambush just got destroyed?

246
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:50,551
The money is on its way. Just, you know, distract him.

247
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:52,595
- I have been. It's exhausting. - You're the best.

248
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:53,846
- Yeah? Really? - Mm-hmm.

249
00:16:54,014 --> 00:16:55,973
Is that why you're buying a $45,000 robot>>

250
00:16:56,141 --> 00:16:57,141
when you owe me six grand in rent?

251
00:16:57,309 --> 00:16:58,267
- Because I'm the best? - Three.

252
00:16:58,435 --> 00:16:59,560
- No, six. - Whoa.

253
00:16:59,728 --> 00:17:03,689
No, listen, Charlie. There is a guy with real money who wants to buy this place.

254
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:06,025
Come on, like you're really going to sell your dad's gym.

255
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:07,776
If you don't make rent, I can't make payments>>

256
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:09,278
and I won't have a choice.

257
00:17:09,446 --> 00:17:11,947
Your father would climb out of his grave and kick your ass if you sold this place.

258
00:17:12,282 --> 00:17:15,075
My father would climb out of his grave and kick your ass.

259
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:19,580
Bailey.

260
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:25,502
- Don't. - Don't what?

261
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,296
Don't do that. Don't... that...>>

262
00:17:27,464 --> 00:17:29,089
Hey.

263
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:31,216
- Don't what? - Don't do that thing.

264
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:35,679
- No, you like that thing. - No.

265
00:17:35,847 --> 00:17:37,973
- Yeah. - No, I don't like that thing.

266
00:17:38,141 --> 00:17:40,059
I used to. Once. Briefly.

267
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:42,061
Now I like money more.

268
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:45,939
- I don't believe you. - I don't care.

269
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:49,610
Marvin.

270
00:17:50,654 --> 00:17:51,904
Your money has arrived.

271
00:17:54,282 --> 00:17:55,908
Marv.

272
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:02,873
Fifty grand, as promised.

273
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:06,001
- Now, here are all our numbers - Right.

274
00:18:06,169 --> 00:18:08,462
- and contact info over in Europe. - All right.

275
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:10,047
So that's everything there.

276
00:18:13,343 --> 00:18:16,095
So Marvin tells me you want this time with Max.

277
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:18,472
- Yeah, yeah. - You did the right thing>>

278
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,141
giving me custody. I think Caroline would have wanted that.

279
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:22,768
Yeah.

280
00:18:22,936 --> 00:18:25,270
Now, have him back in New York on August 27th.

281
00:18:26,523 --> 00:18:27,648
That's a deal.

282
00:18:27,816 --> 00:18:30,818
- OK, well, let's go get Max. - OK.

283
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:33,654
OK? Let's get Max.

284
00:18:35,699 --> 00:18:39,284
It's OK. You want me to go on the other side here and I'll get Max?

285
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:42,871
Hey, Max.

286
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,249
See you, pal.

287
00:18:45,417 --> 00:18:47,960
Max, we'll see you at the end of the summer, honey.

288
00:18:57,804 --> 00:18:59,138
I'm Charlie.

289
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:05,853
It's been a long time. You know, I'm your...>>

290
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,063
- You screwed me. - Nice mouth.

291
00:19:08,231 --> 00:19:09,273
Do you know where they're going?

292
00:19:09,441 --> 00:19:11,442
- Italy? - Yeah, Italy.

293
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:13,652
- So how did I get stuck here with you? - Relax, kid.

294
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,113
You got a whole life of fine living ahead of you.

295
00:19:16,281 --> 00:19:19,908
Charlie, dude's pissed. He's going to take off.

296
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:22,327
- Yeah, OK. - Did Marvin give you that money?

297
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:25,789
Here, just close the deal. I'll be right there, OK?

298
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:28,667
- OK? - Hey.

299
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:30,127
Hey.

300
00:19:30,295 --> 00:19:33,046
- I'm Bailey. - Max.

301
00:19:34,466 --> 00:19:36,258
Max Kenton.

302
00:19:37,427 --> 00:19:39,261
- Wow, OK, so this is your... - Yeah, it's him.

303
00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:41,555
Don't worry about it, OK?

304
00:19:41,723 --> 00:19:42,973
I'm standing here looking at you two...>>

305
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:46,185
Just go and put Noisy in the shop, please? Thank you.

306
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:54,568
So listen, you're going to stay here with her while I'm on the road.

307
00:19:54,736 --> 00:19:55,986
How much did he give you, huh?

308
00:19:56,154 --> 00:19:58,030
You're coming at this the wrong way, kid.

309
00:19:58,198 --> 00:19:59,323
No, tell me. I want to know.

310
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:02,868
50,000. OK?

311
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:05,162
He gave me $50,000 to sign you over to her.

312
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:07,247
Will you shut up now?

313
00:20:07,415 --> 00:20:08,624
You sold me?

314
00:20:10,335 --> 00:20:11,376
Sounds worse than it is.

315
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:14,171
- Really. - It's just to take care of you.

316
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:16,256
Give me half the money and you won't have to.

317
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:19,259
- Where are you going to go? - Give me the money. I'll be fine.

318
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:21,011
I told your aunt I'll get you to New York at the end of the summer.

319
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:22,721
Now you're concerned for Aunt Debra?

320
00:20:23,598 --> 00:20:26,099
You sold me for 50 grand. You owe me half!

321
00:20:26,267 --> 00:20:28,143
I don't have it! I spent the money on a robot.

322
00:20:28,311 --> 00:20:30,521
It's gone! OK? Gone!

323
00:20:30,688 --> 00:20:32,314
I'm through here.

324
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:41,990
All right, what do we got?

325
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:45,202
Noisy Boy has arrived.

326
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:48,080
That's a lot of airline stickers and customs tags.

327
00:20:48,248 --> 00:20:51,500
- Yep, he's been all over the world. - London, Japan, Brazil, São Paulo...>>

328
00:20:51,668 --> 00:20:54,253
Hasn't seen North American soil in over two years.

329
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,755
Maybe that's why you got such a good price, genius.

330
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:02,010
Decided to stay, huh?

331
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:04,304
This is Bailey. She'll be looking after you for a few weeks.

332
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:05,389
- What? - By the way,>>

333
00:21:05,557 --> 00:21:07,975
I need you to look after the kid for a few weeks or, like, eight.

334
00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:12,187
- I want half that money. - Are we back to this again?

335
00:21:12,856 --> 00:21:14,565
Is there a real robot boxer in there?

336
00:21:14,732 --> 00:21:16,275
Noisy Boy's in there. Have you ever heard of him?

337
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:20,445
Of course. He fought Rubicon for the WRB belt in 2016.

338
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:28,453
Holy crap, he looks amazing.

339
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:32,332
Well, his composite armor has been replaced.

340
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,959
Let's see if the insides look as good.

341
00:21:34,127 --> 00:21:37,796
I've watched that fight with Rubicon like 20 times.

342
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:39,840
He should have had him in the third round>>

343
00:21:40,008 --> 00:21:42,843
but Rubicon got lucky with a huge right and ended it.

344
00:21:56,733 --> 00:21:58,025
Relax, kid. he's on our side.

345
00:21:58,192 --> 00:22:00,736
- Not funny. - Kind of funny.

346
00:22:00,904 --> 00:22:02,446
You know he has voice recognition, right?

347
00:22:02,614 --> 00:22:04,448
- No, he doesn't. - He didn't in the League.

348
00:22:04,616 --> 00:22:06,491
When Noisy fought in Brazil, they must have put it in.

349
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:09,286
Brazilians are crazy about that talk-to-your-robot crap.

350
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:13,874
Right, left, uppercut!

351
00:22:17,378 --> 00:22:21,006
Doesn't work. Right, left, uppercut!

352
00:22:21,174 --> 00:22:23,383
I knew that price was too good to be true. We got screwed.

353
00:22:23,551 --> 00:22:24,801
Give me a second. Let me see if I can fix it.

354
00:22:24,969 --> 00:22:26,762
God, look how good he looks, too.

355
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:28,347
Give me two seconds. Let me look at something!

356
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:29,765
Why didn't you ask the guy to have a look at it?

357
00:22:29,933 --> 00:22:31,099
Relax!

358
00:22:34,771 --> 00:22:37,272
Whoa, whoa. What was that? Was that Japanese?

359
00:22:42,654 --> 00:22:44,404
Let me see if I can reset him to English. Hang on.

360
00:22:44,572 --> 00:22:47,407
- How the hell do you know Japanese? - Video games.

361
00:22:48,618 --> 00:22:50,160
You play video games in Japanese?

362
00:22:50,328 --> 00:22:52,079
Japanese bootlegs are always better.

363
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:01,129
- Give me that. - OK, so he's reset to English,>>

364
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:03,340
and I found his command matrix.

365
00:23:03,508 --> 00:23:05,008
They have pre-loaded a bunch of combinations.

366
00:23:05,176 --> 00:23:08,345
- They should be listed here. - Right.

367
00:23:08,513 --> 00:23:10,973
Uh... Top salvo!

368
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:15,268
What did I tell you?

369
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:18,271
Gravity One Downtown!

370
00:23:21,609 --> 00:23:24,444
I was due for some good luck!

371
00:23:24,612 --> 00:23:26,321
- You're welcome. - Thank you.

372
00:23:26,489 --> 00:23:29,366
Bailey, help me put him in the truck. I am going to go and get your money.

373
00:23:42,714 --> 00:23:45,173
- Give me the keys. - I'm coming with you.

374
00:23:45,341 --> 00:23:46,842
- No, you're not. - Why not?

375
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:48,802
Because I don't want you with me, OK?

376
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:52,764
I'm either coming with you, or you're fishing for your keys in the sewer.

377
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:56,018
Your choice. What's it going to be, old man?

378
00:23:57,562 --> 00:24:01,148
Oh, my God. That was close, wasn't it?

379
00:24:01,315 --> 00:24:02,274
Don't do that again.

380
00:24:02,442 --> 00:24:05,027
- Don't, don't, don't. - That's scaring you, isn't it?

381
00:24:05,194 --> 00:24:08,030
- Don't do this again? Whoa, whoa! - Get in. Just get in, will ya?

382
00:24:08,197 --> 00:24:09,197
Give me the keys first.

383
00:24:09,365 --> 00:24:10,699
No, you can wait till I get in the truck.

384
00:24:10,867 --> 00:24:12,993
Thanks, Big Pops.

385
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:20,000
Sweet ride.

386
00:24:20,168 --> 00:24:22,169
Put on your seatbelt and don't talk.

387
00:24:43,357 --> 00:24:45,692
I'm taking all bets!

388
00:25:11,219 --> 00:25:13,011
Keep up. Stay close.

389
00:25:14,806 --> 00:25:16,473
Hey, hey, hey!

390
00:25:16,641 --> 00:25:19,101
Charlie Kenton is in the house!

391
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:20,352
All right, all right.

392
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,604
- Come on, man! - Hey, Finn.

393
00:25:22,772 --> 00:25:25,816
- Is that Noisy Boy? - The one and only.

394
00:25:25,983 --> 00:25:30,153
That's Noisy Boy!

395
00:25:32,323 --> 00:25:34,825
Noisy's been in Japan. Softer bots over there.

396
00:25:34,992 --> 00:25:36,243
You sure you want to fight him tonight?

397
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:39,496
What do you got, Finn? He can take any bot in this place. You know it.

398
00:25:39,664 --> 00:25:42,624
You can have any undercard you want.

399
00:25:42,792 --> 00:25:44,126
- Five thousand guaranteed. - Come on, man.

400
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:47,295
A thousand every round your bot survives.

401
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:49,840
Fight till the death!

402
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:54,386
No. Give me the main event.

403
00:25:54,554 --> 00:25:56,680
- Come on, Charlie. - Finn, this is Noisy Boy.

404
00:25:56,848 --> 00:25:58,557
An original Tak Mashido bot.

405
00:25:58,724 --> 00:26:01,351
He was a World Robot League boxer. Come on!

406
00:26:04,147 --> 00:26:05,981
You want to fight Midas?

407
00:26:06,149 --> 00:26:09,276
Fifty thousand guaranteed, winner takes all.

408
00:26:10,194 --> 00:26:12,237
Fifty? Really, 50?

409
00:26:12,405 --> 00:26:13,613
Now you're talking.

410
00:26:13,781 --> 00:26:15,657
Listen, listen. No, look.

411
00:26:15,825 --> 00:26:17,450
- Listen! - Give me a sec.

412
00:26:17,618 --> 00:26:19,452
We should take an undercard fight, make a little cash>>

413
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:20,829
and get the hell out of here!

414
00:26:20,997 --> 00:26:22,372
All right, first, there is no "we.">>

415
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:25,667
Second, he's going to crush Midas, and I'm going to make real cash!

416
00:26:26,794 --> 00:26:28,420
We'll take Midas!

417
00:26:36,554 --> 00:26:38,930
Yeah!

418
00:26:40,892 --> 00:26:43,560
Tonight, our main event>>

419
00:26:43,728 --> 00:26:48,648
features the gold-blooded killer!

420
00:26:50,151 --> 00:26:52,611
This pimped-out punk>>

421
00:26:52,778 --> 00:26:57,115
is programmed for pain!

422
00:26:57,283 --> 00:27:02,287
I give to you the mighty Midas!

423
00:27:18,346 --> 00:27:19,554
Whoo!

424
00:27:43,246 --> 00:27:46,081
Against a bot>>

425
00:27:46,249 --> 00:27:51,044
who ran with the big boys in the WRB!

426
00:27:52,046 --> 00:27:57,050
He's been on an exile tour overseas, but now he's back home>>

427
00:27:57,218 --> 00:27:59,511
and he's ready to make some noise!

428
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:02,931
Take your first look in a long time>>

429
00:28:03,099 --> 00:28:05,934
at Noisy Boy!

430
00:28:45,808 --> 00:28:47,892
Crash Palace,>>

431
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:52,939
who's ready for some destruction?!

432
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:57,694
Let's make some money! Come on!

433
00:28:57,862 --> 00:29:00,613
We have Midas against Noisy Boy.

434
00:29:00,781 --> 00:29:02,991
Noisy Boy against Midas.

435
00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:06,369
You've been waiting all night for this matchup, Crash Palace!

436
00:29:12,543 --> 00:29:13,752
Scimitar right!

437
00:29:16,964 --> 00:29:18,673
Did you see that?

438
00:29:18,841 --> 00:29:21,801
Easy money, easy money all night. All night long!

439
00:29:21,969 --> 00:29:25,096
Come on! It's not over yet. Let's go!

440
00:29:25,848 --> 00:29:27,390
Skull salvo! Firefight!

441
00:29:30,019 --> 00:29:32,896
- Yeah! Go, Noisy! - Undercard, huh?

442
00:29:35,733 --> 00:29:36,816
Shockfist!

443
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:41,863
Get in there. Shogun Trinity!

444
00:29:43,449 --> 00:29:45,742
Let's finish him. Gravity Slam, Uptown!

445
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:50,705
This son-of-a-bitch is crazy!

446
00:29:50,873 --> 00:29:51,998
Get up!

447
00:29:53,209 --> 00:29:55,418
Full Metal Feud! Bring it!

448
00:29:59,006 --> 00:30:00,548
Southpaw! Pain Revolution!

449
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:03,259
I got something for you.

450
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:08,556
Don't you run from me! You can't run from me!

451
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,642
Get up!

452
00:30:13,854 --> 00:30:15,271
That's illegal!

453
00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:17,273
This is the underworld, kid. There are no rules!

454
00:30:18,109 --> 00:30:19,692
Now we're seeing the Midas touch.

455
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,069
No. Hands up!

456
00:30:21,237 --> 00:30:24,322
Get back in that corner, bitch, and take this whooping like a man!

457
00:30:28,202 --> 00:30:29,786
He's getting killed in there!

458
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:36,584
It's a headset! You talk into it and you tell him what to do!

459
00:30:36,752 --> 00:30:38,169
Panic Shield!

460
00:30:39,046 --> 00:30:41,172
That's it. One-Two Overlord!

461
00:30:45,302 --> 00:30:47,595
No, no. Shatter Punch!

462
00:30:52,143 --> 00:30:53,977
- Five Recall! - Get some!

463
00:30:57,773 --> 00:30:59,649
Jeez, damn it.

464
00:30:59,817 --> 00:31:01,192
Jab, jab!

465
00:31:08,534 --> 00:31:10,285
Right roundhouse! Roundhouse!

466
00:31:10,453 --> 00:31:13,163
Did he just spit his juice in Midas's face?

467
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:15,832
No, you did not spit in Midas's face!

468
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,752
- It's party time now, Crash Palace! - Use your left!

469
00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:22,922
Noisy's trying to do something with his one arm!

470
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:25,717
But Midas pins him, and Daddy goes to work!

471
00:31:31,223 --> 00:31:33,600
No, no, no! Get up!

472
00:31:35,144 --> 00:31:36,144
Get some!

473
00:31:36,312 --> 00:31:37,770
He's got... Just gotta get to the bell.

474
00:31:37,938 --> 00:31:40,106
Move! Get out of the corner!

475
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:45,111
Midas! Midas! Midas!

476
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:48,865
Somebody's ready to serve up a decappuccino!

477
00:31:49,033 --> 00:31:51,951
I got something for you! You ready?

478
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:56,414
Good night! That's a home run for Midas.

479
00:31:56,582 --> 00:31:59,626
And so long to Noisy Boy.

480
00:32:12,389 --> 00:32:15,808
Midas! Midas! Midas!

481
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:34,577
Well, that sucked. You hungry?

482
00:32:34,745 --> 00:32:36,955
I saved what's left of Noisy's voice recognition board.

483
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:39,958
Other than that, he's trash. I got to get a new robot together.

484
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:43,545
I need to find a mainframe. What?

485
00:32:43,712 --> 00:32:45,547
- I hate hamburgers. - What kid hates burgers?

486
00:32:45,714 --> 00:32:47,215
Fine, more for me.

487
00:32:47,591 --> 00:32:48,925
Here, drink this.

488
00:32:49,093 --> 00:32:50,677
You never should have taken that fight.

489
00:32:50,844 --> 00:32:53,555
Really? Really? Thanks, genius.

490
00:32:53,722 --> 00:32:56,474
Do you even think about the stuff you do before you do it?

491
00:32:56,642 --> 00:32:58,726
You had no idea how to fight that fight.

492
00:32:58,894 --> 00:33:02,397
Those combination codes, you didn't know what half of them even meant.

493
00:33:02,565 --> 00:33:04,816
You threw them in there cocky and half-assed.

494
00:33:04,984 --> 00:33:06,734
Of course he lost. You never gave him a chance.

495
00:33:06,902 --> 00:33:09,487
- He wasn't that good. - Noisy Boy was a great robot.

496
00:33:09,655 --> 00:33:12,407
Was. Was a great robot back in the League, back in the day.

497
00:33:12,575 --> 00:33:14,117
But look around you, kid. This place...>>

498
00:33:14,285 --> 00:33:16,536
This place is where once great robots go to die.

499
00:33:16,704 --> 00:33:19,289
So throw him away. That's what you do, right?

500
00:33:19,456 --> 00:33:21,332
Anything you don't need you just throw away.

501
00:33:23,669 --> 00:33:25,378
Wow.

502
00:33:27,006 --> 00:33:28,006
It's been a long night.

503
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:31,134
If you want to sleep indoors tonight, shut up and get in the truck.

504
00:33:31,302 --> 00:33:33,886
Don't look at me like that way. Get in the truck!

505
00:34:01,248 --> 00:34:04,292
Well, they gave me 400 for his head.

506
00:34:22,144 --> 00:34:24,479
You stay put. I'm going to go look for some parts.

507
00:34:24,647 --> 00:34:26,230
- I'm coming with you. - Huh?

508
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:27,774
That drink has my heart pounding.

509
00:34:27,941 --> 00:34:30,109
If I sit in this truck by myself, my head will explode.

510
00:34:30,277 --> 00:34:31,736
Whatever. Just keep up.

511
00:34:42,122 --> 00:34:44,248
Crap.

512
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:45,625
Stay back, stay back, stay back.

513
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:59,847
All right, keep up.

514
00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:01,974
These searchlights are automated,>>

515
00:35:02,142 --> 00:35:04,435
but you got to time them right, so stay close.

516
00:35:05,521 --> 00:35:07,021
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

517
00:35:07,189 --> 00:35:09,941
Keep up. It's all right.

518
00:35:10,109 --> 00:35:12,610
All right. Come on, come on.

519
00:35:13,278 --> 00:35:15,238
- We're going to get caught. - Come on.

520
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,908
Easy, easy. Easy, easy.

521
00:35:19,076 --> 00:35:23,037
Quick, quick. Down in here! Go, go, go!

522
00:35:26,375 --> 00:35:28,209
Robots are on the east side. We got to be quick in here.

523
00:35:30,713 --> 00:35:32,213
Once we're through here, there's no more searchlights.

524
00:35:32,381 --> 00:35:34,173
Quick! Go, go, go!

525
00:35:50,065 --> 00:35:52,316
- Here it is. - What are we looking for?

526
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:55,236
Anything. Anything I could use to put a fighting bot together.

527
00:35:55,404 --> 00:35:56,654
- Hey, look. - What?

528
00:35:58,866 --> 00:36:01,409
It's so small.

529
00:36:01,577 --> 00:36:04,620
Yeah. That's before your time. That's a Generation One,>>

530
00:36:04,788 --> 00:36:07,832
the very first fighting bot. They wanted them to look like us.

531
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,917
The more human, the better.

532
00:36:10,085 --> 00:36:12,628
Crazy how quick everything changed. Here, put that in the cart.

533
00:36:12,796 --> 00:36:14,005
What changed?

534
00:36:14,173 --> 00:36:16,048
A good question. Boxing, human boxing.

535
00:36:16,216 --> 00:36:18,009
- It just faded. - Why?

536
00:36:18,177 --> 00:36:20,303
Because the money moved on.

537
00:36:20,471 --> 00:36:22,972
People wanted more carnage, more show.

538
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:25,349
You had the whole Brazilian underground,>>

539
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:28,352
the Gracies, the Machados, jiu-jitsu, Muay Thai,>>

540
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:31,564
and 1,000 styles in between. Full-on ground-and-pound.

541
00:36:31,732 --> 00:36:32,857
- Look at this. - What's that?

542
00:36:33,025 --> 00:36:35,818
- I don't know. - Not bad. Good spot, kid.

543
00:36:35,986 --> 00:36:39,113
You still had human fighters, human bodies>>

544
00:36:39,281 --> 00:36:41,449
so you couldn't give the people what they really wanted:>>

545
00:36:41,617 --> 00:36:44,786
true, no-holds-barred violence.

546
00:36:46,663 --> 00:36:48,664
So the next logical step:>>

547
00:36:48,832 --> 00:36:51,876
get the humans out of there and let the machines kill each other.

548
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:55,087
Do you miss it?

549
00:36:56,381 --> 00:36:59,467
- Boxing. Do you miss it? - Careful.

550
00:36:59,635 --> 00:37:01,135
What? I want to know.

551
00:37:01,303 --> 00:37:02,970
Careful, you're on a cliff.

552
00:37:06,141 --> 00:37:07,099
Whoa!

553
00:37:07,267 --> 00:37:10,603
That's a long way down. If you fell, you'd definitely...>>

554
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:17,109
- Charlie! - Max!

555
00:37:19,363 --> 00:37:21,781
Charlie, help me!

556
00:37:46,181 --> 00:37:50,434
Charlie!

557
00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:52,603
Max! Max!

558
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:55,314
Max!

559
00:37:56,358 --> 00:37:57,441
Max! Max!

560
00:37:57,609 --> 00:38:01,529
- Try not to move! - I'm on some sort of robot arm.

561
00:38:01,697 --> 00:38:05,658
Wait! Just easy, easy. Give me your hand. Nice and easy.

562
00:38:05,826 --> 00:38:08,953
Very slowly. Good. OK, don't look down.

563
00:38:09,121 --> 00:38:12,540
Look at me. Look at me. That's it! I've got you, Max!

564
00:38:12,708 --> 00:38:14,208
You don't have to be scared. I got you!

565
00:38:14,376 --> 00:38:16,711
- It's so far! - It's OK. I got you.

566
00:38:16,879 --> 00:38:19,213
Give me your other hand. Nice and slow.

567
00:38:19,381 --> 00:38:21,966
Just give me your other hand very slowly.

568
00:38:22,134 --> 00:38:24,260
Reach back. Come on. Reach!

569
00:38:25,178 --> 00:38:27,471
All right, look at me. We're going to do this together.

570
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:29,390
You and me. Just look at me.

571
00:38:29,558 --> 00:38:31,601
That's it. That's it.

572
00:38:31,768 --> 00:38:35,313
One... two... three!

573
00:38:37,399 --> 00:38:39,317
That's it. I got you!

574
00:38:39,484 --> 00:38:42,737
I got you. I got you. I got you.

575
00:38:42,905 --> 00:38:46,240
I got you. I got you.

576
00:38:48,952 --> 00:38:51,162
You're safe. You're safe.

577
00:38:55,083 --> 00:38:57,001
All right, I got you.

578
00:38:57,169 --> 00:38:58,461
- You all right? - Yeah.

579
00:38:58,629 --> 00:39:00,546
Come here. Easy. Easy.

580
00:39:02,382 --> 00:39:03,799
You all right?

581
00:39:03,967 --> 00:39:06,010
- You all right? - Yeah.

582
00:39:06,178 --> 00:39:07,887
I told you it was dangerous.

583
00:39:08,722 --> 00:39:10,473
Careful. We're still on the edge here.

584
00:39:22,736 --> 00:39:26,280
Charlie, I think there's a whole robot in there.

585
00:39:26,448 --> 00:39:27,823
So what? Let's go. Come on.

586
00:39:28,909 --> 00:39:30,910
I'm taking him with me. He saved my life.

587
00:39:31,078 --> 00:39:34,580
He did not save your life. I saved your life. Let's go.

588
00:39:34,748 --> 00:39:37,083
Could you just bring the cart to the edge? I'll use the winch to get him out.

589
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:40,795
You want that piece of junk? You get the cart yourself. I'm through here.

590
00:41:25,817 --> 00:41:27,902
This is what's left of Noisy Boy?

591
00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:30,196
That's it. His head does make a nice addition>>

592
00:41:30,363 --> 00:41:33,032
to the front of the Crash Palace.

593
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,743
- It's not funny. - Let's get a robot, you and me.

594
00:41:35,911 --> 00:41:39,038
Yeah, good idea. You're broke. I'm almost there myself.

595
00:41:39,206 --> 00:41:41,749
- You destroyed the best shot you had. - We'll put one together.

596
00:41:41,917 --> 00:41:44,001
You're brilliant at this. There's good stuff here.

597
00:41:44,169 --> 00:41:45,711
- No, there's nothing here. - There is. Look.

598
00:41:45,879 --> 00:41:50,257
Charlie, all your junk is... it's junk.

599
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:52,843
You're not even in the game anymore, Charlie.

600
00:41:53,011 --> 00:41:54,929
- It's all garbage. - I heard you. It's garbage.

601
00:41:55,096 --> 00:41:56,847
Don't get loud with me.

602
00:41:57,015 --> 00:41:59,141
- You're your problem, Charlie. - What's that supposed to mean?

603
00:41:59,309 --> 00:42:03,354
I have been here for you a long time. In the ring, out of the ring,>>

604
00:42:03,522 --> 00:42:05,606
and the whole ugly spiral down, and I'm tired.

605
00:42:05,774 --> 00:42:09,193
My father invested everything he had in your fight career.

606
00:42:09,361 --> 00:42:10,653
We loved...>>

607
00:42:11,571 --> 00:42:16,784
He loved you like family. And this is his home.

608
00:42:16,952 --> 00:42:19,620
I'm just trying not to let it die. That's my plan.

609
00:42:20,997 --> 00:42:22,331
What's yours?

610
00:42:34,177 --> 00:42:35,636
You're done, right?

611
00:42:35,804 --> 00:42:36,971
You're finally done?

612
00:42:37,138 --> 00:42:40,558
Because I sure as hell am, Charlie.

613
00:42:41,726 --> 00:42:43,227
I got nothing left.

614
00:42:45,313 --> 00:42:46,313
All right.

615
00:42:48,567 --> 00:42:51,402
Maybe there's something here.

616
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:53,946
This robot the kid brought in last night.

617
00:42:54,114 --> 00:42:55,781
Would you look at it for me?

618
00:42:56,366 --> 00:42:57,449
Please?

619
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:01,161
Bailey?

620
00:43:06,042 --> 00:43:08,127
I've never seen anything like it before.

621
00:43:08,295 --> 00:43:10,296
He's Generation Two, but barely.

622
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:12,423
I found a power cell that fits him,>>

623
00:43:12,591 --> 00:43:15,843
and I hooked him up to this old G-2 remote that I had, so...>>

624
00:43:16,011 --> 00:43:17,970
You can at least move him around, Charlie, but he's crap.

625
00:43:18,138 --> 00:43:20,973
Maybe I can get a sparring gig for him, make a few hundred bucks.

626
00:43:21,141 --> 00:43:24,101
- Charlie, stop. - It's my robot!

627
00:43:24,269 --> 00:43:27,313
It took me half the night dragging him out of there.

628
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,064
- He's mine. - He's yours? Yeah.

629
00:43:29,232 --> 00:43:31,692
But the parts we're putting in him are mine!

630
00:43:32,777 --> 00:43:36,447
You idiots should see if he powers up before you start fighting over him.

631
00:43:36,615 --> 00:43:37,865
What happened to you?

632
00:43:41,828 --> 00:43:43,412
Hey.

633
00:43:54,424 --> 00:43:56,467
Whoa. Whoa.

634
00:43:56,635 --> 00:43:58,344
Watch out. Stay back.

635
00:44:16,738 --> 00:44:19,782
Looks like he's got a shadow function. That's pretty rare.

636
00:44:20,742 --> 00:44:22,910
He can mime your movements and store them in memory, Max.

637
00:44:23,078 --> 00:44:25,245
You think there's anything here we could use?

638
00:44:25,413 --> 00:44:27,247
- Not much. - There's a bucket...>>

639
00:44:28,458 --> 00:44:30,417
There's a bucket I use to wash the truck sometimes.

640
00:44:30,585 --> 00:44:33,462
Use it and clean him up. He smells like crap.

641
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:36,548
Wash yourself off, too, while you're at it. You stink.

642
00:44:36,716 --> 00:44:40,260
I switched him to remote. It's pretty basic.

643
00:44:40,428 --> 00:44:42,972
Just use the toggles here to steer him and walk him.

644
00:44:43,139 --> 00:44:45,891
- You play video games, right? - Of course.

645
00:44:46,059 --> 00:44:48,852
Same idea, only this one's a thousand-pound robot.

646
00:44:49,562 --> 00:44:50,562
Cool.

647
00:45:24,973 --> 00:45:26,306
"Atom.">>

648
00:45:33,773 --> 00:45:36,942
His name is Atom. Can we get him a fight?

649
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:38,694
I don't think he was ever a boxing robot.

650
00:45:38,862 --> 00:45:42,614
He's a G-2, built in early 2014. He was a sparring bot.

651
00:45:42,782 --> 00:45:44,283
They must have built robots like this one>>

652
00:45:44,451 --> 00:45:46,285
that could mirror the fighting style of any other robot.

653
00:45:46,453 --> 00:45:48,704
OK, so can we get him a fight?

654
00:45:48,872 --> 00:45:51,206
Are you not listening? He's a sparring bot.

655
00:45:51,374 --> 00:45:54,084
Built to take a lot of hits, but never dishing out any real punishment.

656
00:45:54,252 --> 00:45:55,836
You could always sell him off for parts.

657
00:45:56,004 --> 00:45:57,296
Can't you get him a fight?

658
00:45:57,464 --> 00:45:59,506
"Why can't you get him a fight? Get him a fight.">>

659
00:45:59,674 --> 00:46:01,467
God, you don't quit, do you?

660
00:46:01,634 --> 00:46:04,470
You want me to put him in some bottom-rung scrap-fest to the death?

661
00:46:04,637 --> 00:46:07,389
I saw how scared you were at Crash Palace.

662
00:46:07,557 --> 00:46:09,850
The places that would let you fight this robot>>

663
00:46:10,018 --> 00:46:11,727
would make you pee your little pants.

664
00:46:11,895 --> 00:46:14,313
Excellent. Get him a fight.

665
00:46:20,403 --> 00:46:21,361
Stubborn kid.

666
00:46:21,529 --> 00:46:23,489
Surprise, surprise.

667
00:47:04,864 --> 00:47:06,198
Let's take a walk.

668
00:48:15,977 --> 00:48:17,394
Can you understand me?

669
00:48:25,361 --> 00:48:28,530
Don't worry. Your secret's safe with me.

670
00:48:53,473 --> 00:48:56,016
You've known Charlie a long time.

671
00:48:56,184 --> 00:48:59,519
Too long. We both kind of grew up in this gym.

672
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:02,814
My dad, he trained him.

673
00:49:04,192 --> 00:49:06,652
That's them. That's Charlie.

674
00:49:09,072 --> 00:49:10,989
- What was he like? - As a boxer?

675
00:49:11,157 --> 00:49:12,491
As anything.

676
00:49:12,825 --> 00:49:17,287
He was something. He was lean, tough.

677
00:49:17,455 --> 00:49:19,289
No quit, no fear.

678
00:49:23,836 --> 00:49:26,546
Come here. I want to show you something.

679
00:49:27,590 --> 00:49:31,677
I have this newspaper article from Phoenix 2007>>

680
00:49:31,844 --> 00:49:35,430
when Charlie fought Nico Tandy, the top contender.

681
00:49:35,598 --> 00:49:38,392
- You were at the Nico Tandy fight? - I was.

682
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:41,228
Charlie was just supposed to be a warm-up fight, an easy win.

683
00:49:41,396 --> 00:49:45,023
Nico wasn't even supposed to break a sweat>>

684
00:49:45,191 --> 00:49:50,278
but nobody told Charlie that, so he just kept coming and coming at him.

685
00:49:50,446 --> 00:49:51,780
Check this out.

686
00:49:54,575 --> 00:49:56,493
That's Charlie.

687
00:49:57,662 --> 00:49:59,371
First, Nico couldn't believe the balls>>

688
00:49:59,706 --> 00:50:00,747
on this nobody.

689
00:50:00,915 --> 00:50:05,127
But Charlie kept coming, and that's when Nico looked scared.

690
00:50:05,294 --> 00:50:07,129
- Really? - Really.

691
00:50:07,296 --> 00:50:09,047
He was toying with Nico.

692
00:50:09,215 --> 00:50:12,092
The top contender, number two in the world>>

693
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:15,554
and Charlie was dancing with him. Pop! Pop! Bam! Pop!

694
00:50:15,722 --> 00:50:18,765
Charlie was floating inches off the canvas that night.

695
00:50:18,933 --> 00:50:21,768
He was like a ghost. Nico couldn't even see him.

696
00:50:23,062 --> 00:50:24,062
I could.

697
00:50:27,233 --> 00:50:31,028
He was beautiful.

698
00:50:33,823 --> 00:50:36,533
So what happened? Did Charlie beat Nico Tandy?

699
00:50:36,701 --> 00:50:40,495
No, Nico Tandy put me on my ass in the 12th round. Twice.

700
00:50:40,663 --> 00:50:42,330
Second time for good. Lights out.

701
00:50:42,498 --> 00:50:44,583
You were ahead on the scorecards going into the 12th round.

702
00:50:44,751 --> 00:50:47,627
Nico Tandy rung my bell and went on to be the undefeated>>

703
00:50:47,795 --> 00:50:49,129
world champ for the next three years.

704
00:50:49,297 --> 00:50:52,007
- So he knocked you out? - Yeah, so did a lot of guys.

705
00:50:52,175 --> 00:50:53,341
You knocked a lot of guys out, too.

706
00:50:53,509 --> 00:50:55,385
24 and 19. It's not exactly a career.

707
00:50:55,553 --> 00:50:57,012
But every fight a knockout.

708
00:50:57,180 --> 00:50:59,056
- Yeah. - Win or lose, fight's not over>>

709
00:50:59,223 --> 00:51:00,515
- till someone's on the mat. - Till someone's on the mat.

710
00:51:00,683 --> 00:51:03,185
- Your old man taught me that. - Damn straight he taught you that.

711
00:51:03,352 --> 00:51:05,604
- Who else did you fight? - Go get your stuff together.

712
00:51:05,772 --> 00:51:07,647
I don't need to. Did you fight for the title?

713
00:51:07,815 --> 00:51:11,068
Yeah, you do. We leave in an hour. Go.

714
00:51:11,235 --> 00:51:13,570
Wow. Here.

715
00:51:14,864 --> 00:51:16,323
Keep it.

716
00:51:17,658 --> 00:51:20,202
- Thanks. - You're welcome.

717
00:51:24,874 --> 00:51:26,583
I like that kid.

718
00:51:27,543 --> 00:51:28,835
He likes you.

719
00:51:33,883 --> 00:51:37,302
- What I said yesterday was... - No, nothing more to say.

720
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:42,140
I'm heading off to Atlanta tonight to see if I can get a partner>>

721
00:51:42,308 --> 00:51:43,934
or raise money to get a new bot.

722
00:51:45,186 --> 00:51:49,022
That's what you wanted, right? Me gone?

723
00:51:53,236 --> 00:51:55,529
Yeah, that's what I wanted.

724
00:52:04,038 --> 00:52:05,038
OK.

725
00:52:38,823 --> 00:52:40,115
Hey. Hey.

726
00:52:41,117 --> 00:52:42,284
Look.

727
00:52:49,417 --> 00:52:51,960
The champ is here. Zeus is here.

728
00:52:52,128 --> 00:52:53,170
Yeah.

729
00:52:55,965 --> 00:52:59,801
Zeus! No one has ever gone two rounds with this monster.

730
00:52:59,969 --> 00:53:01,136
Two rounds!

731
00:53:01,304 --> 00:53:04,681
The champ puts his Real Steel world championship belt on the line tonight.

732
00:53:04,849 --> 00:53:06,808
He just may have a real fight on his hands.

733
00:53:06,976 --> 00:53:10,437
Zeus, greatest robot boxer of all time. Ever.

734
00:53:10,605 --> 00:53:12,230
End of story. Good night!

735
00:53:13,191 --> 00:53:16,484
- So cool. It's so cool. - What?

736
00:53:18,821 --> 00:53:19,821
Come on.

737
00:53:21,616 --> 00:53:24,576
All right, listen up. I got to go find Finn.

738
00:53:24,744 --> 00:53:27,537
- I want you to stay in this area, OK? - OK.

739
00:53:27,705 --> 00:53:30,498
Out of the way. Champ coming through. Zeus coming through.

740
00:53:30,666 --> 00:53:32,042
Move, move. Champ coming through.

741
00:53:44,555 --> 00:53:47,641
Farra Lemkova, daughter behind the father-daughter Zeus team.

742
00:53:47,808 --> 00:53:51,228
They say your father's the money and you are the mind behind Zeus.

743
00:53:51,395 --> 00:53:53,355
You're very kind,>>

744
00:53:53,522 --> 00:53:55,440
but I assure you, the mind behind Zeus>>

745
00:53:55,608 --> 00:53:57,275
belongs to the great Tak Mashido.

746
00:53:59,487 --> 00:54:02,197
What did it take to lure the reclusive genius, former boy wonder>>

747
00:54:02,365 --> 00:54:04,199
and arguably the most important bot designer>>

748
00:54:04,367 --> 00:54:07,118
in the history of the sport out of retirement?

749
00:54:08,371 --> 00:54:10,372
Why don't you ask him yourself?

750
00:54:15,378 --> 00:54:18,421
Is this Tak Mashido's greatest creation?

751
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:23,635
Zeus is autonomous and constantly evolving during a fight.

752
00:54:23,803 --> 00:54:27,847
With his adaptive operating system he recognizes patterns>>

753
00:54:28,015 --> 00:54:32,185
and rewrites his fight code instantaneously.

754
00:54:32,353 --> 00:54:35,689
For myself and Joe Sixpack out there, are you saying that Zeus...>>

755
00:54:35,856 --> 00:54:40,694
I'm saying that no matter what happens in that ring,>>

756
00:54:40,861 --> 00:54:44,281
the result of any fight is inevitable.

757
00:54:45,449 --> 00:54:46,992
What Zeus sees...>>

758
00:54:48,494 --> 00:54:49,828
...he kills.

759
00:54:51,372 --> 00:54:52,956
Sweet.

760
00:55:22,153 --> 00:55:23,403
I'm never going into business with you.

761
00:55:23,571 --> 00:55:25,322
I just need a break here, Finn. C'mon.

762
00:55:25,489 --> 00:55:27,115
You got that old bot truck out there.

763
00:55:27,283 --> 00:55:29,034
- You always got something in there. - I got an old G-2 sparring bot,>>

764
00:55:29,201 --> 00:55:32,162
ain't worth the paint left on it. What am I supposed to do with that?

765
00:55:32,330 --> 00:55:35,248
The Zoo. Take him to the Zoo. They fight there tomorrow.

766
00:55:35,416 --> 00:55:37,000
Even I wouldn't be caught dead at the Zoo.

767
00:55:37,168 --> 00:55:39,878
I just need a little loan. Something...>>

768
00:55:40,046 --> 00:55:41,671
What?

769
00:55:42,798 --> 00:55:44,466
- You're serious, Charlie? - A loan.

770
00:55:44,633 --> 00:55:47,719
Something. A couple hundred. Few hundred. Whatever you got.

771
00:55:47,887 --> 00:55:49,763
You know I'm good for it.

772
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:54,309
I know you, and as much as I like you, dude...>>

773
00:55:54,477 --> 00:55:56,227
...you're a bad bet, brother.

774
00:56:00,149 --> 00:56:01,524
Right, yeah.

775
00:56:13,788 --> 00:56:16,206
- Get back. - All right. All right.

776
00:56:21,379 --> 00:56:23,755
Did you see that? That's what's left of Axelrod.

777
00:56:23,923 --> 00:56:25,840
Where you been? I told you to stay put.

778
00:56:26,008 --> 00:56:27,926
You should have seen him. Zeus was, like, amazing!

779
00:56:28,094 --> 00:56:30,261
- Amazing, huh? - Unbelievable, yeah.

780
00:56:30,429 --> 00:56:33,431
He was just peppering Axelrod with punches, but so fast.

781
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:36,226
It was incredible. Axelrod didn't even land a punch.

782
00:56:36,394 --> 00:56:38,061
He didn't even survive the first round.

783
00:56:38,229 --> 00:56:39,479
Is that what you think boxing is?

784
00:56:39,647 --> 00:56:41,731
Zeus beating up some piece of steel that they feed him?

785
00:56:41,899 --> 00:56:44,651
Axelrod's not just some piece of steel. And that is what boxing is now.

786
00:56:44,819 --> 00:56:47,404
Deal with it. And I love it, and I'm in it now.

787
00:56:47,571 --> 00:56:50,365
You're in it now, are you? You and your G-2 sparring bot?

788
00:56:50,533 --> 00:56:53,952
He's more than that. And if you'd just get us a fight, you'd see.

789
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:57,288
You're in luck, kid. There's a lovely place called the Zoo.

790
00:56:57,456 --> 00:56:58,957
Tomorrow afternoon, you'll get your fight.

791
00:56:59,125 --> 00:57:01,292
- Great. - And it will be the end.

792
00:57:02,878 --> 00:57:05,046
I told you I hate hamburgers!

793
00:57:08,884 --> 00:57:10,051
It's a burrito!

794
00:57:18,853 --> 00:57:19,936
Right uppercut.

795
00:57:23,065 --> 00:57:24,149
Left uppercut.

796
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:31,656
Bend your knees. Rise up with both hands.

797
00:57:33,617 --> 00:57:38,455
Again. Bend your knees. Rise up with both hands.

798
00:57:38,622 --> 00:57:41,958
- You been up all night? - Yeah. I cleaned him up.

799
00:57:42,126 --> 00:57:44,043
I'm using shadow mode to program some fight moves>>

800
00:57:44,211 --> 00:57:45,211
and sync them to the remote.

801
00:57:45,379 --> 00:57:48,631
Yeah. I saw that double-up punch you were showing him.

802
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:50,925
That's... That's lethal stuff.

803
00:57:51,093 --> 00:57:52,385
Let's do this.

804
00:57:52,553 --> 00:57:55,513
Jeez. Let's do breakfast first.

805
00:58:32,885 --> 00:58:34,761
You know you're bringing him home in pieces, right?

806
00:58:37,014 --> 00:58:38,181
We'll see.

807
00:58:45,731 --> 00:58:47,774
Let me deal with this.

808
00:58:47,942 --> 00:58:49,275
Charlie Kenton. This is Max.

809
00:58:49,443 --> 00:58:51,319
Kingpin. Call me Kingpin.

810
00:58:51,487 --> 00:58:53,780
- All right, Kingpin, so... - How much a round?

811
00:58:53,948 --> 00:58:55,615
What's this, we on a field trip?

812
00:58:57,868 --> 00:59:00,245
All right. He can fight my robot Metro.

813
00:59:00,412 --> 00:59:02,121
I'll give you a 100 bucks for one two-minute round.

814
00:59:02,289 --> 00:59:03,540
- Take it. - Three hundred.

815
00:59:03,707 --> 00:59:08,086
One hundred. Baby boy, I'm going to give you $100 just to get in with Metro.

816
00:59:08,254 --> 00:59:09,921
How about 500 for two rounds?

817
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:12,257
Two rounds.

818
00:59:12,424 --> 00:59:14,592
Two rounds, son, he ain't going to survive one round.

819
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:17,262
- What if he does? - He ain't.

820
00:59:17,429 --> 00:59:19,931
Let's just say he does.

821
00:59:21,892 --> 00:59:25,144
If he's still standing after one round...>>

822
00:59:26,355 --> 00:59:29,023
- ...I'll give you 1,000 bucks. Shut it! - A 1,000...>>

823
00:59:33,112 --> 00:59:34,612
But if he dies in there,>>

824
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:36,447
which he will, junior...>>

825
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:40,702
...I get to keep what's left.

826
00:59:42,413 --> 00:59:43,705
Take the 100.

827
00:59:44,373 --> 00:59:46,165
Deal.

828
00:59:46,333 --> 00:59:49,002
We're on. We on!

829
00:59:51,714 --> 00:59:53,631
Let's go!

830
00:59:53,799 --> 00:59:54,757
You should have taken the 100.

831
00:59:54,925 --> 00:59:57,343
- I got us a thousand. - Yeah, if he wins.

832
01:00:23,037 --> 01:00:24,579
You want me to drive?

833
01:00:24,747 --> 01:00:26,289
He's my bot. I got this!

834
01:00:26,457 --> 01:00:29,625
This ain't a video game, kid. This is for real. Right here.

835
01:00:29,793 --> 01:00:32,962
You said he's coming home in pieces. What difference does it make?

836
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:34,297
All right.

837
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:37,383
I got this.

838
01:00:37,551 --> 01:00:39,761
Let's get it on! Let's get it on!

839
01:00:39,928 --> 01:00:43,598
Let's get it on like Ping-Pong in Hong Kong!

840
01:00:43,766 --> 01:00:46,434
Give me a bell! Give me a bell!

841
01:00:58,447 --> 01:01:00,740
Don't watch Atom. Watch your opponent. Watch him.

842
01:01:00,908 --> 01:01:03,242
Watch out for that foot. He's looking to pin you.

843
01:01:04,703 --> 01:01:07,205
I told you to watch for that foot plant. Come on.

844
01:01:09,041 --> 01:01:10,666
Here comes the sledgehammer.

845
01:01:15,756 --> 01:01:17,757
Did you see that?

846
01:01:17,925 --> 01:01:20,259
- Come on! Get him! - Don't yell at him, control him.

847
01:01:20,427 --> 01:01:22,428
Slip right. Back step.

848
01:01:23,138 --> 01:01:25,348
Duck. You're welcome.

849
01:01:25,516 --> 01:01:27,809
- Shut up! You're not helping! - Actually, I think I am.

850
01:01:27,976 --> 01:01:29,268
No, no, no, no, no.

851
01:01:29,436 --> 01:01:32,188
Backhand. You got speed on this guy.

852
01:01:32,356 --> 01:01:34,107
Just keep moving. Bob.

853
01:01:34,274 --> 01:01:35,316
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

854
01:01:40,614 --> 01:01:42,782
Slip out of that corner. Keep moving! Bob and weave!

855
01:01:45,035 --> 01:01:46,953
That's it! Now you're listening to me.

856
01:01:56,713 --> 01:02:00,216
He can take a hit. I'll give you this, kid. Your bot can take a hit.

857
01:02:02,803 --> 01:02:05,304
You better slip that headlock 'cause this ain't gonna end well for you.

858
01:02:05,472 --> 01:02:06,472
I'm trying!

859
01:02:13,105 --> 01:02:15,273
Thirty seconds!

860
01:02:16,733 --> 01:02:19,318
Thirty se... Half a minute.

861
01:02:19,486 --> 01:02:22,113
Half a minute! Keep moving! Just move!

862
01:02:25,367 --> 01:02:27,577
C'mon, you've got 20 seconds!

863
01:02:28,328 --> 01:02:30,997
That's a thousand bucks. Twenty seconds. Let me... Let me take over!

864
01:02:31,165 --> 01:02:32,874
- No... - Just move, then. Move!

865
01:02:40,007 --> 01:02:41,257
Come on.

866
01:02:41,425 --> 01:02:43,468
Get up, Atom. Get up, Atom.

867
01:02:45,596 --> 01:02:47,763
Count with me! Count with me! One!

868
01:02:47,931 --> 01:02:48,890
Get up, Atom!

869
01:02:49,057 --> 01:02:51,142
He can't hear you... You know you're talking to a machine?

870
01:02:51,310 --> 01:02:53,728
Four! Five! Six!

871
01:02:53,896 --> 01:02:55,438
Get up, Atom!

872
01:02:55,606 --> 01:02:57,857
All the way up! All the way up!

873
01:02:58,025 --> 01:03:00,443
- No! - Yeah!

874
01:03:00,611 --> 01:03:02,570
Yes! Yes!

875
01:03:07,034 --> 01:03:08,826
I'm going to fix it! I'm going to fix it!

876
01:03:10,662 --> 01:03:12,788
I'm going to fix it! Come on, now.

877
01:03:12,956 --> 01:03:14,582
- This 1,000 bucks... - Yeah, 1,000.

878
01:03:14,750 --> 01:03:16,584
...double or nothing he can't make another round.

879
01:03:16,752 --> 01:03:18,294
- Yeah, thanks anyway. - Deal. Double or nothing.

880
01:03:18,462 --> 01:03:20,671
Baby boy said it! We're back on! We on!

881
01:03:20,839 --> 01:03:23,174
Are you crazy? You threw away a 1,000 bucks!

882
01:03:23,342 --> 01:03:25,384
He can barely stand up in there.

883
01:03:25,552 --> 01:03:28,012
Look, I really need the money.

884
01:03:29,056 --> 01:03:31,516
I know. Let's work.

885
01:03:33,185 --> 01:03:34,268
Ah, Jesus.

886
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:41,984
- Watch that. Watch that. - I got that.

887
01:03:47,032 --> 01:03:49,075
Huh?

888
01:03:49,243 --> 01:03:51,452
- Whoa! Whoa! - Yeah!

889
01:03:55,123 --> 01:03:58,376
- I got it. - That's a system failure!

890
01:03:59,378 --> 01:04:01,045
- I don't got it. - He's going down.

891
01:04:05,092 --> 01:04:07,843
- Yes! - No!

892
01:04:08,428 --> 01:04:10,805
Start... Hey, hey! Start the count!

893
01:04:11,723 --> 01:04:12,807
Start the count!

894
01:04:12,975 --> 01:04:15,893
One! Two! Three!

895
01:04:16,061 --> 01:04:20,648
Four! Five! Six! Seven!

896
01:04:20,816 --> 01:04:22,775
Eight! Nine!

897
01:04:22,943 --> 01:04:24,443
Ten!

898
01:04:24,611 --> 01:04:27,905
You did it! We did it! Wow!

899
01:04:31,451 --> 01:04:33,536
Yeah!

900
01:04:33,704 --> 01:04:36,289
Time to go. Come on. Grab your robot.

901
01:04:37,082 --> 01:04:40,876
I know, I know! I know! I know!

902
01:04:41,044 --> 01:04:42,795
Kingpin, pay up.

903
01:04:42,963 --> 01:04:46,007
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know, I know, I know.

904
01:04:46,174 --> 01:04:49,760
- We owned! - Let's go. Come on, come on.

905
01:04:49,928 --> 01:04:51,679
- Yeah? - Have I got a fight for you.

906
01:04:51,847 --> 01:04:54,557
Saturday night. Guaranteed four grand.

907
01:04:54,725 --> 01:04:56,058
Seven if he wins.

908
01:04:56,226 --> 01:04:58,352
Four grand? You're on. Let's go!

909
01:05:07,571 --> 01:05:11,616
Bailey, it's me. He won.

910
01:05:11,783 --> 01:05:14,035
Can you believe that? The kid's robot actually won.

911
01:05:16,163 --> 01:05:17,246
I know.

912
01:05:19,499 --> 01:05:22,043
Oh, yeah, oh, happy? Oh, my God. Yeah.

913
01:05:22,210 --> 01:05:24,629
He's been bit. He's been bit real bad.

914
01:05:27,257 --> 01:05:29,425
Yeah. Anyway, I...>>

915
01:05:31,762 --> 01:05:33,471
...I just wanted you to know.

916
01:06:04,002 --> 01:06:05,294
Jab.

917
01:06:07,130 --> 01:06:14,178
Jab, jab, hook.

918
01:06:17,516 --> 01:06:19,183
I think you have to move your feet.

919
01:06:21,895 --> 01:06:25,898
Your feet. Feet.

920
01:07:45,562 --> 01:07:46,979
Nice moves, kid.

921
01:07:49,232 --> 01:07:50,608
How long you been out here?

922
01:07:51,610 --> 01:07:53,235
- Check it out. - What?

923
01:07:53,403 --> 01:07:55,529
I just spent the night doing something I think is amazing.

924
01:07:55,697 --> 01:07:58,282
Incredibly amazing. If it works, you know?

925
01:07:58,450 --> 01:08:00,618
- You know his remote was spotty? - Yeah.

926
01:08:00,786 --> 01:08:01,952
I killed it.

927
01:08:02,329 --> 01:08:04,747
- Got rid of it. We don't need it anymore. - How did you...>>

928
01:08:05,999 --> 01:08:07,750
I had to start over.

929
01:08:07,918 --> 01:08:10,503
But I was able to use the spin frame from Ambush...>>

930
01:08:10,670 --> 01:08:14,298
...and take the circuitry sleeve out of Noisy Boy and it works.

931
01:08:14,466 --> 01:08:17,676
He knows nothing, but it works. It really, really works.

932
01:08:17,844 --> 01:08:18,928
What works?

933
01:08:20,472 --> 01:08:21,680
I got to turn it on.

934
01:08:24,434 --> 01:08:25,935
Left jab, right uppercut!

935
01:08:28,063 --> 01:08:29,188
Japan!

936
01:08:29,356 --> 01:08:31,857
You put Noisy's voice recognition into Atom?

937
01:08:32,025 --> 01:08:35,611
- Pretty smart, kid. - Smart? It could be genius!

938
01:08:35,779 --> 01:08:38,322
It could be the most incredible thing in the history of the entire world!

939
01:08:38,490 --> 01:08:40,407
Easy there, chief, easy. Whoa! Whoa!

940
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:43,035
- Did you drink all these sodas? - I might have had a few.

941
01:08:43,203 --> 01:08:46,038
- I need you to teach him to box. - Are you kidding me?

942
01:08:46,206 --> 01:08:48,916
He's nowhere near advanced enough to handle Noisy's voice command.

943
01:08:49,084 --> 01:08:51,085
So he needs your moves. Your commands.

944
01:08:51,253 --> 01:08:53,838
- Start over from the ground up. - Forget it, kid. Forget it.

945
01:08:54,005 --> 01:08:57,508
You were a boxer, Charlie. Yesterday at the Zoo,>>

946
01:08:57,676 --> 01:09:00,219
you could see things happen before they even happened.

947
01:09:00,387 --> 01:09:02,721
I haven't boxed in a long time. I'm not starting now.

948
01:09:02,889 --> 01:09:04,431
Who's going to teach him to fight?

949
01:09:04,599 --> 01:09:07,351
You're doing fine, Max. You don't need me. Sorry.

950
01:09:11,773 --> 01:09:13,607
That was really cool, though, that dance.

951
01:09:13,775 --> 01:09:16,735
You should do that on Saturday night.

952
01:09:16,903 --> 01:09:19,780
- Don't make fun of me. - I'm serious.

953
01:09:19,948 --> 01:09:22,575
Before the fight, when you guys take the ring, you should do it.

954
01:09:22,742 --> 01:09:25,953
There's no way I'm dancing with a robot in front of a boxing crowd.

955
01:09:26,121 --> 01:09:29,498
A box... Are you kidding me? This is just a show.

956
01:09:29,666 --> 01:09:31,709
People want to see something they've never seen.

957
01:09:31,877 --> 01:09:34,587
Look. You think of all the greats.

958
01:09:34,754 --> 01:09:37,256
Think Ali, Sugar Ray, Prince Rakim, Gammer,>>

959
01:09:37,424 --> 01:09:39,341
they all had their nicknames.

960
01:09:39,509 --> 01:09:42,511
They had their personas. They all had flair.

961
01:09:42,679 --> 01:09:44,930
Now you? You might not have much robot,>>

962
01:09:45,098 --> 01:09:47,141
but with that dance, you got flair.

963
01:09:47,309 --> 01:09:50,603
Plus, you're a kid. People love that kid thing.

964
01:09:50,770 --> 01:09:53,397
- What are you? Like nine? Ten? - I'm 11.

965
01:09:53,565 --> 01:09:55,691
OK. Are you sure you're 11?

966
01:09:55,859 --> 01:09:58,611
Yes. I'm sure I'm 11.

967
01:10:00,030 --> 01:10:03,032
Anyway, the point is people want to see that.

968
01:10:06,620 --> 01:10:08,537
You're really not messing with me?

969
01:10:08,705 --> 01:10:11,081
I am not messing with you. They're going to love it.

970
01:10:14,336 --> 01:10:15,502
- OK. - Cool.

971
01:10:15,670 --> 01:10:16,921
- But... - What?

972
01:10:17,088 --> 01:10:19,590
I won't do it unless you help me.

973
01:10:21,593 --> 01:10:23,052
I can't dance. You're on your own there.

974
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:25,220
No. Boxing.

975
01:10:25,388 --> 01:10:26,722
- Oh, I see. - I program the robot.

976
01:10:26,890 --> 01:10:29,058
- You teach him to box. - And you dance.

977
01:10:29,225 --> 01:10:30,559
And you dance.

978
01:10:32,896 --> 01:10:34,104
- Yeah. - Yeah?

979
01:10:34,272 --> 01:10:37,191
Deal.

980
01:10:37,359 --> 01:10:38,442
Deal.

981
01:10:39,611 --> 01:10:41,487
All right.

982
01:10:41,655 --> 01:10:42,988
It's going to be cool.

983
01:11:37,794 --> 01:11:38,877
Nice.

984
01:11:41,047 --> 01:11:42,381
You're going to be punching guys bigger.

985
01:11:42,549 --> 01:11:44,508
You're going to have to punch up.

986
01:11:44,676 --> 01:11:45,759
That's it.

987
01:11:46,845 --> 01:11:47,845
Nice.

988
01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:55,853
You, too, old man?

989
01:11:56,021 --> 01:11:57,896
Come on. Let's get to work.

990
01:12:00,567 --> 01:12:02,735
Nice! Let's do that again.

991
01:12:04,529 --> 01:12:06,572
Nice. Three-punch combo.

992
01:12:07,782 --> 01:12:09,116
Combo.

993
01:12:10,118 --> 01:12:11,869
Again. Again.

994
01:12:12,996 --> 01:12:16,415
Faster. Faster. Nice.

995
01:12:18,084 --> 01:12:20,753
You're not even out of breath. I like it.

996
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:22,254
Let's see how you move.

997
01:12:28,094 --> 01:12:30,345
That's good.

998
01:13:06,132 --> 01:13:08,717
Step around. Left hook. Left hook.

999
01:13:25,318 --> 01:13:26,985
That's it. Every time.

1000
01:13:45,046 --> 01:13:46,380
Great fight, fellas.

1001
01:13:54,305 --> 01:13:57,891
105.5, W-R-U-T, the satellite home of robot boxing.

1002
01:13:58,059 --> 01:13:59,601
Caller two, what do you got for me?

1003
01:13:59,769 --> 01:14:02,146
Have you heard about this little bot out there, his name is Atom?

1004
01:14:02,313 --> 01:14:03,522
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

1005
01:14:03,690 --> 01:14:05,899
My buddies and I saw him the other night, and he dances.

1006
01:14:06,067 --> 01:14:07,943
- Did you say "dances"? - You heard me.

1007
01:14:08,111 --> 01:14:09,862
He dances pre-fight with this little kid,>>

1008
01:14:10,029 --> 01:14:11,905
and the crowd went nuts for these two.

1009
01:14:12,073 --> 01:14:13,323
I'll tell you what's really something,>>

1010
01:14:13,491 --> 01:14:14,741
you put the gimmick aside for a second>>

1011
01:14:14,909 --> 01:14:17,452
and I'm holding here a list of the bots he's beaten.

1012
01:14:17,620 --> 01:14:19,872
Chaos. Wall Street. One-Eyed Jack.

1013
01:14:20,039 --> 01:14:21,790
No slouches on that list, right?

1014
01:14:21,958 --> 01:14:24,126
But folks, Atom's fought them all, beat them all.

1015
01:14:24,294 --> 01:14:26,378
I'm telling you, Tommy, this bot is fast!

1016
01:14:26,546 --> 01:14:28,714
He escapes shots from these bigger bots, it's insane!

1017
01:14:28,882 --> 01:14:30,465
No doubt, no doubt. I'm telling you, listeners,>>

1018
01:14:30,633 --> 01:14:33,886
you remember this name: Atom. That's right, A-T-O-M.

1019
01:14:34,053 --> 01:14:35,095
Atom!

1020
01:14:35,263 --> 01:14:36,930
This bot is one to watch.

1021
01:14:41,853 --> 01:14:44,188
- Awesome fight, sir. - Thanks, thanks.

1022
01:14:44,355 --> 01:14:46,356
Great fight, guys.

1023
01:14:46,524 --> 01:14:47,858
- Kenton, you guys put on a good show. - Thanks.

1024
01:14:48,026 --> 01:14:49,902
Good enough, we'd like to invite you to fight on our card,>>

1025
01:14:50,069 --> 01:14:51,862
Virgin America Spectrum Detroit, Friday night.

1026
01:14:52,030 --> 01:14:55,616
Right. Whoa. That's a WRB... That's a League fight.

1027
01:14:55,783 --> 01:14:58,202
Damn right it is. What do you say, fellas?

1028
01:14:58,369 --> 01:14:59,828
You ready for the show?

1029
01:15:01,539 --> 01:15:02,706
Heck, yeah.

1030
01:15:11,507 --> 01:15:15,302
It's the undercard, but it's still a League fight.

1031
01:15:15,470 --> 01:15:18,513
I just want you to be relaxed. I want you to be relaxed, OK, Max.

1032
01:15:18,681 --> 01:15:20,057
No freaking out.

1033
01:15:20,225 --> 01:15:21,600
Don't get all freaky-deaky on me.

1034
01:15:21,768 --> 01:15:24,102
You go freaky-deaky, this whole thing can go south.

1035
01:15:24,270 --> 01:15:26,271
Whatever you do, have fun, have fun.

1036
01:15:26,439 --> 01:15:27,856
You got to have fun, you understand me?

1037
01:15:28,024 --> 01:15:30,025
We've come too far to get out there>>

1038
01:15:30,193 --> 01:15:31,985
and freak out and blow this whole thing.

1039
01:15:32,153 --> 01:15:35,530
We're going to have fun, and we gonna... we're gonna not freak out!

1040
01:15:35,698 --> 01:15:39,076
We're going to stay loose, and we're just going to bam him.

1041
01:15:39,244 --> 01:15:42,788
I tell ya, man, I've spent my whole life waiting to get here. We're going to...>>

1042
01:15:43,581 --> 01:15:47,751
Because, I tell ya what... Trust me when I say no freaking out. You got it?

1043
01:15:47,919 --> 01:15:50,420
- Yeah, I got it. - Good.

1044
01:15:50,588 --> 01:15:55,759
You have been invited to Lemkova Suite. Follow me, please.

1045
01:15:55,927 --> 01:15:57,427
What was that? One more time.

1046
01:15:57,595 --> 01:16:00,013
Lemkova Suite. Zeus Suite.

1047
01:16:00,181 --> 01:16:04,393
Sure. Yeah. Let's head up to the champ's suite. Sure.

1048
01:16:33,381 --> 01:16:34,506
Wow.

1049
01:16:34,674 --> 01:16:36,466
Gentlemen, I'm Farra Lemkova.

1050
01:16:36,634 --> 01:16:38,593
Yeah. I'm Charlie Kenton and...>>

1051
01:16:38,761 --> 01:16:40,721
And this, of course, is Tak Mashido.

1052
01:16:40,888 --> 01:16:44,057
Holy shit. It's Tak Mashido.

1053
01:16:44,225 --> 01:16:46,351
I know you have a very important fight tonight,>>

1054
01:16:46,519 --> 01:16:47,644
so I'll get right to it.

1055
01:16:47,812 --> 01:16:49,563
It's a little far from the action for my liking.

1056
01:16:49,731 --> 01:16:53,108
It's nice. I like it, though. Very nicely...>>

1057
01:16:53,276 --> 01:16:55,193
Wow, that is... That's a great shot.

1058
01:16:55,361 --> 01:16:57,988
Look at that. You want an autograph? Would you mind...>>

1059
01:16:58,156 --> 01:16:59,614
I'd like to buy your robot.

1060
01:17:01,826 --> 01:17:03,994
He'd be useful sparring bot for Zeus.

1061
01:17:04,162 --> 01:17:06,163
And for that I'm willing to pay.

1062
01:17:07,165 --> 01:17:10,208
$200,000.

1063
01:17:10,376 --> 01:17:12,502
- Done. - He's not for sale.

1064
01:17:12,670 --> 01:17:15,255
- Of course he is. We can definitely... - He's not for sale.

1065
01:17:15,423 --> 01:17:17,382
You are 15 minutes away>>

1066
01:17:17,550 --> 01:17:20,469
from getting in the ring with Twin Cities,>>

1067
01:17:20,636 --> 01:17:22,387
a vicious League bot.

1068
01:17:22,555 --> 01:17:26,058
So, to be clear, my offer stands>>

1069
01:17:26,225 --> 01:17:27,809
until the starting bell.

1070
01:17:27,977 --> 01:17:30,395
OK. And just to be clear,>>

1071
01:17:30,563 --> 01:17:32,189
he's not for sale!

1072
01:17:32,357 --> 01:17:34,858
Not now, not ever.

1073
01:17:35,026 --> 01:17:37,819
Listen, give me a minute to clear this up, OK?

1074
01:17:37,987 --> 01:17:40,822
Tak, how are you? Max!

1075
01:17:40,990 --> 01:17:45,577
Max. Max. Be smart. I know you love him>>

1076
01:17:45,745 --> 01:17:48,121
but in 20 minutes there may be nothing left to love.

1077
01:17:48,289 --> 01:17:50,457
Think about it. Take the offer.

1078
01:17:50,625 --> 01:17:52,918
You think about it. Why does she want Atom?

1079
01:17:53,086 --> 01:17:55,629
Huh? Because he's different from other bots!

1080
01:17:55,797 --> 01:17:57,422
Yeah, he's different. He's smaller and weaker,>>

1081
01:17:57,590 --> 01:17:58,673
and he's going to get his ass kicked.

1082
01:17:58,841 --> 01:18:03,261
He's a boxer. We taught him to box. You taught him to box!

1083
01:18:03,429 --> 01:18:05,389
- That's worth something. - I think it is, too.

1084
01:18:05,556 --> 01:18:08,809
I think it's worth 200 grand. Two hundred grand.

1085
01:18:08,976 --> 01:18:11,895
Charlie, we can go round and round this all night long.

1086
01:18:12,063 --> 01:18:13,522
Look at me, look at me.

1087
01:18:14,816 --> 01:18:16,149
But it's not going to happen.

1088
01:18:17,402 --> 01:18:18,735
I got a fight to get to.

1089
01:18:33,334 --> 01:18:37,003
Ladies and gentlemen, tonight>>

1090
01:18:37,171 --> 01:18:41,883
the march towards the Real Steel Championship>>

1091
01:18:42,051 --> 01:18:45,470
makes its way through Detroit's>>

1092
01:18:45,638 --> 01:18:49,099
Virgin America Spectrum!

1093
01:18:53,312 --> 01:18:57,732
Kicking off the evening, in our first undercard,>>

1094
01:18:57,900 --> 01:19:00,652
the two-headed tyrant,>>

1095
01:19:00,820 --> 01:19:05,198
Twin Cities!

1096
01:19:35,438 --> 01:19:40,859
Opposing Twin Cities, in his first professional fight,>>

1097
01:19:41,027 --> 01:19:44,362
hailing from parts unknown...>>

1098
01:19:44,530 --> 01:19:46,364
...Atom!

1099
01:20:41,921 --> 01:20:43,213
- Nice work, boss. - Thanks.

1100
01:20:43,381 --> 01:20:45,632
- Did you switch him to fight mode? - Of course.

1101
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:47,467
All right, now this bot is tough to put down.

1102
01:20:47,635 --> 01:20:48,593
Atom can do it.

1103
01:20:48,761 --> 01:20:53,014
Max, look over there. You see those geeks with the joysticks and consoles?

1104
01:20:53,182 --> 01:20:54,432
They're controlling everything their bot does.

1105
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:56,518
They're monitoring his systems, seeing what he sees,>>

1106
01:20:56,686 --> 01:20:58,103
stadium feeds of the fights, everything.

1107
01:20:58,271 --> 01:21:00,272
This is not like the underground handheld remote bots>>

1108
01:21:00,439 --> 01:21:02,649
we've been fighting. This is the League. Stand on that.

1109
01:21:02,817 --> 01:21:04,359
So what do we do?

1110
01:21:05,111 --> 01:21:08,613
We fight smart, we be patient. And pray.

1111
01:21:10,116 --> 01:21:11,866
Seriously, pray.

1112
01:21:13,452 --> 01:21:15,161
Ready!

1113
01:21:16,706 --> 01:21:18,498
- Ready! - Hands up.

1114
01:21:18,666 --> 01:21:20,917
Fighters ready! Fight!

1115
01:21:24,755 --> 01:21:26,673
Engage.

1116
01:21:26,841 --> 01:21:28,425
Slip! Right!

1117
01:21:28,593 --> 01:21:30,927
Lean back. Right, left!

1118
01:21:31,095 --> 01:21:32,304
Cover up!

1119
01:21:35,474 --> 01:21:36,808
Duck! Left roundhouse!

1120
01:21:39,562 --> 01:21:40,562
Damn it.

1121
01:21:48,446 --> 01:21:50,280
Lean left! Lean right!

1122
01:21:50,448 --> 01:21:51,990
Cover up! Cover up!

1123
01:21:52,158 --> 01:21:53,158
What's going on in there?

1124
01:21:53,326 --> 01:21:55,160
Too many hits. He's taking too many hits.

1125
01:22:01,042 --> 01:22:02,334
Get your hands up!

1126
01:22:05,171 --> 01:22:07,005
Get out of that corner! Move!

1127
01:22:10,051 --> 01:22:12,594
Come on, Charlie. He's getting killed in there! Tell him what to do!

1128
01:22:12,762 --> 01:22:15,472
That guy's got two heads, and about a foot of reach on us, and no blind spot.

1129
01:22:15,640 --> 01:22:17,432
He's got to have a weakness. Find it!

1130
01:22:23,356 --> 01:22:24,689
Wait, wait, wait.

1131
01:22:25,399 --> 01:22:28,151
Right shoulder, right shoulder, right shoulder! He's got a tell!

1132
01:22:28,319 --> 01:22:30,820
He's got a hitch in his shoulder every time he throws that right bomb!

1133
01:22:30,988 --> 01:22:33,114
- So? - We got him! See? Here it comes again!

1134
01:22:33,282 --> 01:22:35,950
Duck! Spin! Slide left! Roundhouse! One, two!

1135
01:22:36,118 --> 01:22:39,371
Backstep. Backstep. Backstep. Lean right.

1136
01:22:39,538 --> 01:22:41,539
Come on, Charlie! Get in there!

1137
01:22:41,707 --> 01:22:44,167
Got to get in close where he can't use that size and reach on us!

1138
01:22:44,335 --> 01:22:47,504
Left to the body! Right to the body! Left to the body!

1139
01:22:47,672 --> 01:22:49,005
Yeah, it's working!

1140
01:22:49,173 --> 01:22:51,091
Stay downstairs! Left, right, left!

1141
01:22:52,593 --> 01:22:53,843
These program modes aren't working.

1142
01:22:54,011 --> 01:22:55,261
Left! Right hook, slip!

1143
01:22:55,429 --> 01:22:57,305
Right uppercut! Left uppercut!

1144
01:22:57,473 --> 01:22:59,099
Duck left. Counter right!

1145
01:22:59,266 --> 01:23:01,810
- Get him, Atom! - Here comes the Charlie Special.

1146
01:23:01,977 --> 01:23:04,979
Three-punch combo to the body! Out! In! Counter!

1147
01:23:05,147 --> 01:23:07,023
- Two-one-two. - Two-one-two.

1148
01:23:07,191 --> 01:23:08,608
Stay on him! Lunging right!

1149
01:23:10,403 --> 01:23:11,403
No!

1150
01:23:11,570 --> 01:23:14,072
Don't let him go. Right to the body! Straight right to the head!

1151
01:23:19,203 --> 01:23:22,163
- That's it, we got a systems crash! - Get him, Atom!

1152
01:23:24,542 --> 01:23:25,375
Damn it!

1153
01:23:25,543 --> 01:23:26,751
This is not happening. This is not happening, man.

1154
01:23:26,919 --> 01:23:29,295
- Put him away, Charlie! - Spin left!

1155
01:23:30,297 --> 01:23:31,631
Spin right!

1156
01:23:33,843 --> 01:23:35,760
- Finish him! - Do it!

1157
01:23:35,928 --> 01:23:37,095
Right uppercut!

1158
01:23:39,682 --> 01:23:40,974
- Yeah! - Yeah!

1159
01:23:41,142 --> 01:23:43,017
Yeah!

1160
01:23:43,185 --> 01:23:45,895
Ah! Ah!

1161
01:23:47,398 --> 01:23:48,481
He's down!

1162
01:23:49,483 --> 01:23:52,694
One! Two! Three!

1163
01:23:52,862 --> 01:23:55,363
Four! Five!

1164
01:23:55,531 --> 01:23:57,949
- Six! Seven! - We got him. Stay down!

1165
01:23:59,076 --> 01:24:01,703
He's out! He's out!

1166
01:24:01,871 --> 01:24:03,997
- Yeah! - Yeah!

1167
01:24:07,793 --> 01:24:08,835
Yeah!

1168
01:24:11,839 --> 01:24:13,631
Corner!

1169
01:24:13,799 --> 01:24:16,760
Corner! Corner!

1170
01:24:18,387 --> 01:24:20,764
Victory!

1171
01:24:20,931 --> 01:24:25,143
In a time of one minute, 47 seconds>>

1172
01:24:25,311 --> 01:24:29,397
of the first round, Atom has defeat...>>

1173
01:24:30,608 --> 01:24:33,318
I want to thank everyone for coming out tonight!

1174
01:24:35,863 --> 01:24:40,116
Our little bot from the junkyard got a shot at a League fight.

1175
01:24:40,284 --> 01:24:41,618
How about that?

1176
01:24:42,912 --> 01:24:47,457
And the last thing I want to say to a special girl who won't be named,>>

1177
01:24:47,625 --> 01:24:50,585
Farra Lemkova.

1178
01:24:53,255 --> 01:24:54,214
Whoa, OK, hang on.

1179
01:24:54,381 --> 01:24:55,799
That instead of buying my robot,>>

1180
01:24:55,966 --> 01:24:57,550
and using your money to control this sport...>>

1181
01:24:57,718 --> 01:24:59,427
- That's it! - Wait, I'm not done.

1182
01:24:59,595 --> 01:25:02,680
Why not give the littlest guy the biggest shot?

1183
01:25:02,848 --> 01:25:06,643
Seriously, because I bet if you give him a shot, he'll surprise you!

1184
01:25:06,811 --> 01:25:08,728
Wouldn't you like to see a little guy get a shot>>

1185
01:25:08,896 --> 01:25:12,857
at the Real Steel Championship?

1186
01:25:14,610 --> 01:25:18,154
I challenge Zeus to a fight.

1187
01:25:19,782 --> 01:25:24,160
Any time, any place, anywhere!

1188
01:25:24,328 --> 01:25:26,663
You name it! We will be there!

1189
01:25:26,831 --> 01:25:28,581
Yeah! OK!

1190
01:25:35,047 --> 01:25:36,965
I'm going to get us that fight!

1191
01:25:41,762 --> 01:25:43,888
Atom, Atom, Atom...>>

1192
01:25:56,819 --> 01:25:59,070
That was a ballsy move, you challenging Zeus like that.

1193
01:25:59,238 --> 01:26:00,738
That's one thing to call it.

1194
01:26:00,906 --> 01:26:02,407
I think a lot of people would like to see that fight.

1195
01:26:02,575 --> 01:26:05,285
- You're damn right they would. - You listening to this kid? Jeez!

1196
01:26:05,452 --> 01:26:07,161
- Good fight, fellas. - Thanks, man.

1197
01:26:07,329 --> 01:26:09,080
- Look at this. Let's celebrate. - Yeah.

1198
01:26:09,248 --> 01:26:12,417
- All right, 70-30, right? - Yeah, 70 for me and 30 for you.

1199
01:26:12,585 --> 01:26:14,544
- That's so right. - That's very funny.

1200
01:26:14,712 --> 01:26:16,921
I told you we shouldn't have sold him.

1201
01:26:17,089 --> 01:26:20,300
OK. No, no, no. I remember now. Who's right?

1202
01:26:20,467 --> 01:26:22,719
Say who's right. Say "Max is right.">>

1203
01:26:22,887 --> 01:26:24,804
All right, all right. All right.

1204
01:26:24,972 --> 01:26:28,349
- We're a good team. - No, no. Max is right.

1205
01:26:28,684 --> 01:26:31,102
That was unbelievable. Thank you, Twin Cities.

1206
01:26:33,063 --> 01:26:35,023
- Whoo! All right, we set? - Yeah.

1207
01:26:35,190 --> 01:26:38,192
- All right, let's do it. - Charlie boy.

1208
01:26:38,360 --> 01:26:41,654
- Ricky, I was just going to call you. - Oh, yeah.

1209
01:26:41,822 --> 01:26:44,657
I actually really was going to call you.

1210
01:26:44,825 --> 01:26:46,451
Don't worry about that.

1211
01:26:46,619 --> 01:26:48,536
That was a heck of a fight.

1212
01:26:48,704 --> 01:26:51,080
Congratulations to both of you. That was really good.

1213
01:26:51,248 --> 01:26:54,208
It was an amazing fight. That was a great job, young man.

1214
01:26:55,210 --> 01:26:56,544
- Come on, man. - What?

1215
01:26:56,712 --> 01:27:00,757
- You serious? - You thought I was joking>>

1216
01:27:00,925 --> 01:27:02,592
when I said I'd beat you within an inch of your life?

1217
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:05,845
He thought that was a joke. How about that? It wasn't a joke.

1218
01:27:06,013 --> 01:27:10,183
I got a kid here. And I have your money. We don't have a problem.

1219
01:27:10,351 --> 01:27:12,977
I'm sure you do, Charlie, but...>>

1220
01:27:13,145 --> 01:27:16,147
...but I think we know it's about much more than money, don't we?

1221
01:27:16,315 --> 01:27:18,441
All right. What do you want?

1222
01:27:18,609 --> 01:27:21,611
You want 25, 30? You want 30 grand?

1223
01:27:21,779 --> 01:27:23,321
- I got the money in cash here. - Yeah, right.

1224
01:27:23,489 --> 01:27:26,616
Let's go! Max, go! Go, go! Run!

1225
01:27:26,784 --> 01:27:30,119
- Run! Come on. Keep up! - Get him now!

1226
01:27:30,287 --> 01:27:31,579
Run! Come on!

1227
01:27:33,457 --> 01:27:35,208
Get off him! Get off him!

1228
01:27:38,545 --> 01:27:39,545
Come here!

1229
01:27:43,926 --> 01:27:45,093
Hey, Ricky.

1230
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:46,761
That's his money! Leave him out of this!

1231
01:27:48,806 --> 01:27:49,806
Hey!

1232
01:27:59,191 --> 01:28:00,400
Stop!

1233
01:28:03,570 --> 01:28:04,779
Stop!

1234
01:28:04,947 --> 01:28:08,574
Take all his money. Take it all.

1235
01:28:11,203 --> 01:28:13,538
Your friend's a real dirtbag, kid.

1236
01:28:13,706 --> 01:28:15,373
He's my father!

1237
01:28:17,584 --> 01:28:22,213
Well. Looks like a little less than an inch of your life.

1238
01:28:22,381 --> 01:28:25,299
Well, buddy, that will teach him.

1239
01:28:28,554 --> 01:28:30,722
Whoo!

1240
01:28:30,889 --> 01:28:33,725
Just like old times, Charlie boy!

1241
01:28:33,892 --> 01:28:35,226
Let's go, boys.

1242
01:28:40,024 --> 01:28:41,983
Charlie.

1243
01:29:01,128 --> 01:29:05,339
I'm sorry, Max. I'm sorry. Sorry.

1244
01:29:45,380 --> 01:29:47,340
- What are we doing here? - Max, just...>>

1245
01:29:47,508 --> 01:29:49,801
Is it Farra? She called you, didn't she?

1246
01:29:49,968 --> 01:29:52,470
- We're going to get the Zeus fight. - Listen, it's not the Zeus people.

1247
01:29:52,638 --> 01:29:55,765
I've been thinking about all this, and...>>

1248
01:29:56,892 --> 01:29:57,892
Max!

1249
01:29:58,852 --> 01:30:00,603
Max?

1250
01:30:03,649 --> 01:30:05,316
Max.

1251
01:30:07,569 --> 01:30:10,029
It's so good to see you.

1252
01:30:10,197 --> 01:30:12,281
- What is she doing here? - It's better if you go with her now.

1253
01:30:12,449 --> 01:30:14,909
We get beat up, so you call her to come and get me?

1254
01:30:15,077 --> 01:30:16,786
He's been beat up. I told you he couldn't take care of him!

1255
01:30:16,954 --> 01:30:19,497
Yeah. I called her. Look at us. We're a mess.

1256
01:30:19,665 --> 01:30:21,707
We're fine. She can leave!

1257
01:30:21,875 --> 01:30:24,877
Atom's fighting good. We can make the money back.

1258
01:30:25,629 --> 01:30:27,421
Charlie, please.

1259
01:30:28,340 --> 01:30:29,590
Just...>>

1260
01:30:32,594 --> 01:30:35,138
Charlie, we're doing so good.

1261
01:30:37,099 --> 01:30:39,016
Charlie, please, no.

1262
01:30:40,269 --> 01:30:43,354
Don't. Don't. Don't.

1263
01:30:43,522 --> 01:30:46,899
Please. Please.

1264
01:30:51,488 --> 01:30:54,532
Trust me, kid. It's better this way, all right?

1265
01:30:55,367 --> 01:30:57,952
I know you think you know what's right, but you don't.

1266
01:30:58,120 --> 01:30:59,954
You're too young. You don't know.

1267
01:31:00,122 --> 01:31:01,539
Look at me, trust me.

1268
01:31:01,707 --> 01:31:05,084
And legally she has custody, so what can I do?

1269
01:31:06,170 --> 01:31:07,837
You tell me, what can I do?

1270
01:31:12,509 --> 01:31:14,260
Max!

1271
01:31:23,270 --> 01:31:25,688
I don't want your money, Marvin.

1272
01:31:25,856 --> 01:31:27,940
Max, we have our own swimming pool>>

1273
01:31:28,108 --> 01:31:32,862
and we have a hot tub and a lot of super fun toys to play with.

1274
01:31:33,030 --> 01:31:35,531
Do you want to play with them? It's going to be fun.

1275
01:31:36,450 --> 01:31:37,909
What's going on?

1276
01:31:38,076 --> 01:31:41,495
He won't even talk to me, so thanks for that, Charlie.

1277
01:31:41,663 --> 01:31:43,247
I'm going to wait in the car.

1278
01:31:45,876 --> 01:31:48,336
You don't want to talk, fine. I'll talk.

1279
01:31:48,503 --> 01:31:50,379
What do you want me to say? I'm sorry?

1280
01:31:50,547 --> 01:31:55,593
You knew from day one what this was. You decided to take the ride.

1281
01:31:56,261 --> 01:32:00,389
I mean, what? Max, you thought me, you, and a little robot from the junk heap>>

1282
01:32:00,557 --> 01:32:03,726
were going to ride off into the sunset? Come on.

1283
01:32:04,895 --> 01:32:07,188
No, you forgot who I was!

1284
01:32:13,320 --> 01:32:14,737
You deserve better...>>

1285
01:32:16,198 --> 01:32:17,365
...than me.

1286
01:32:21,495 --> 01:32:23,537
Will you say something, please?

1287
01:32:23,705 --> 01:32:26,165
I tried, OK. What do you want from me?

1288
01:32:26,333 --> 01:32:28,042
I want you to fight for me.

1289
01:32:29,294 --> 01:32:31,087
That's all I ever wanted.

1290
01:34:36,463 --> 01:34:37,797
No, don't ask.

1291
01:34:39,299 --> 01:34:41,509
So no Max.

1292
01:34:42,761 --> 01:34:46,388
It's better this way. Marv and Debra have money. Max is set.

1293
01:34:46,556 --> 01:34:49,475
Did you not see the way he looked at you?

1294
01:34:49,643 --> 01:34:51,769
Charlie, that's the way I looked at my dad.

1295
01:34:51,937 --> 01:34:54,313
Even now I would give anything to have that back.

1296
01:34:54,481 --> 01:34:59,235
Your dad was special. He was in your corner from day one.

1297
01:34:59,402 --> 01:35:00,986
Me, come on. I blew it.

1298
01:35:02,989 --> 01:35:04,448
I blew it.

1299
01:35:05,575 --> 01:35:07,201
When Max was born I just...>>

1300
01:35:07,369 --> 01:35:09,203
...freaked out.

1301
01:35:09,371 --> 01:35:11,622
But something would have been better than nothing.

1302
01:35:11,790 --> 01:35:12,915
I just wouldn't know where to start.

1303
01:35:13,083 --> 01:35:14,250
- Yeah, you do. - I don't.

1304
01:35:14,417 --> 01:35:15,751
- You do. - No.

1305
01:35:16,586 --> 01:35:17,878
You do.

1306
01:35:50,871 --> 01:35:52,079
I got to go.

1307
01:35:55,041 --> 01:35:56,709
Twelve-hundred miles for a kiss.

1308
01:35:58,128 --> 01:36:00,504
Worth it. Worth it.

1309
01:36:11,808 --> 01:36:13,517
Go get him, Charlie.

1310
01:36:16,897 --> 01:36:18,314
You sound like your dad.

1311
01:36:40,462 --> 01:36:42,338
Hey.

1312
01:36:46,426 --> 01:36:50,429
OK. Uh, look, I know you think I abandoned you>>

1313
01:36:50,597 --> 01:36:53,432
and I guess I did originally.

1314
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:56,352
- Then you sold me. - Charlie.

1315
01:36:56,519 --> 01:36:59,396
- Hey. - You have no business being here.

1316
01:36:59,564 --> 01:37:01,982
That's true. You've got full custody. He's yours.

1317
01:37:02,150 --> 01:37:04,610
And I know I've done all kinds of wrong by this kid,>>

1318
01:37:04,778 --> 01:37:06,946
but if you'll let me...>>

1319
01:37:08,198 --> 01:37:10,324
...I'd just like to do one thing right.

1320
01:37:13,161 --> 01:37:14,245
Right.

1321
01:37:15,872 --> 01:37:17,623
- Now, where were we? - You sold me.

1322
01:37:17,791 --> 01:37:21,085
- Right, yeah, that happened. - Wait, what?

1323
01:37:21,253 --> 01:37:23,921
- Then we had our asses kicked. - And you slept on a shelf in a truck,>>

1324
01:37:24,089 --> 01:37:25,381
- and it was awful. - And dangerous.

1325
01:37:25,715 --> 01:37:30,469
Really dangerous. I mean, I know. God. I'm sorry.

1326
01:37:31,471 --> 01:37:34,431
That's why you came? To say you're sorry?

1327
01:37:34,599 --> 01:37:36,934
No. I mean yes. Yes.

1328
01:37:39,854 --> 01:37:41,355
But no.

1329
01:37:41,523 --> 01:37:44,358
No, I came to tell you that I heard you.

1330
01:37:44,526 --> 01:37:48,737
I got it. I'm a little slow, but I got it.

1331
01:37:48,905 --> 01:37:53,033
I know you had a bum ride, Max, and I wasn't there and I should have been.

1332
01:37:54,244 --> 01:37:55,452
I should have been.

1333
01:37:56,579 --> 01:37:58,956
Your mom was...>>

1334
01:37:59,124 --> 01:38:00,374
She was cool, wasn't she?

1335
01:38:01,918 --> 01:38:03,544
She was.

1336
01:38:03,712 --> 01:38:05,754
She was the coolest.

1337
01:38:05,922 --> 01:38:08,465
Yeah, she was.

1338
01:38:11,636 --> 01:38:13,637
And I'm sorry about...>>

1339
01:38:15,640 --> 01:38:17,558
...what happened with her.

1340
01:38:19,644 --> 01:38:24,189
And I can't get those years back, Max, but...>>

1341
01:38:24,357 --> 01:38:26,984
...but I'm here right now...>>

1342
01:38:27,152 --> 01:38:30,738
...and if you're up for it, I'm ready to fight.

1343
01:38:44,461 --> 01:38:46,211
We got the Zeus fight.

1344
01:38:46,588 --> 01:38:47,588
What?

1345
01:38:48,173 --> 01:38:50,174
No, no, we didn't.

1346
01:38:50,342 --> 01:38:52,968
You got the Zeus fight.

1347
01:38:56,473 --> 01:38:59,725
So what do you say, Debra? Can we do this one last thing?

1348
01:39:03,229 --> 01:39:04,396
One night.

1349
01:39:04,564 --> 01:39:06,023
One night. It's all we need. Thank you.

1350
01:39:10,820 --> 01:39:14,740
We'll probably get our asses kicked, but at least we'll go down swinging.

1351
01:39:14,908 --> 01:39:16,116
Yeah?

1352
01:39:16,284 --> 01:39:17,951
What do you say?

1353
01:39:19,913 --> 01:39:21,997
Welcome, everyone, to New York's Bing Arena>>

1354
01:39:22,165 --> 01:39:24,458
and the Real Steel Championship Bout.

1355
01:39:24,626 --> 01:39:26,960
Well, Tim, it's the fight we never thought we'd see.

1356
01:39:27,128 --> 01:39:29,338
Zeus, the undefeated WRB champion>>

1357
01:39:29,506 --> 01:39:32,800
against the underdog, rising star Atom.

1358
01:39:32,967 --> 01:39:34,885
The champ's handlers have agreed to fight>>

1359
01:39:35,053 --> 01:39:37,513
outside the circle of well-known League bots>>

1360
01:39:37,680 --> 01:39:41,683
and have decided to give the people a true David versus Goliath spectacle.

1361
01:39:41,851 --> 01:39:45,354
Now, Tim, help me out on this. Has the Zeus camp lost their mind?

1362
01:39:45,522 --> 01:39:48,107
The greatest robot boxer of all time gives a shot at the belt>>

1363
01:39:48,274 --> 01:39:50,317
to a G-2 named Atom?

1364
01:39:50,485 --> 01:39:54,238
Well, Herb, if you ask Tak Mashido, Team Zeus has lost their minds.

1365
01:39:54,406 --> 01:39:56,657
Now, he may look cool as he enters the arena>>

1366
01:39:56,825 --> 01:39:59,827
but he has made no bones about his disdain for this matchup.

1367
01:39:59,994 --> 01:40:02,788
Our cameras tried to catch up with him earlier this week.

1368
01:40:02,956 --> 01:40:05,707
Take a look at this clip. Mashido wouldn't even stop to talk to the press,>>

1369
01:40:05,875 --> 01:40:09,336
referring only to this fight as an insult to his creation.

1370
01:40:09,504 --> 01:40:11,588
Now, in truth, Herb, Max Kenton, Atom's trainer,>>

1371
01:40:11,756 --> 01:40:13,173
did more than just challenge Zeus.

1372
01:40:13,341 --> 01:40:14,758
He did so publicly.

1373
01:40:14,926 --> 01:40:18,345
The challenge went viral and created a PR nightmare for the champ.

1374
01:40:18,513 --> 01:40:20,722
No argument there, Tim. And I think the Zeus camp>>

1375
01:40:20,890 --> 01:40:23,851
- knows exactly what they're doing. - That they do. I mean, come on.

1376
01:40:24,018 --> 01:40:26,937
Giving a shot at the belt to a nobody from nowhere.

1377
01:40:27,105 --> 01:40:30,274
This "junkyard dog," if you will. That's a marketing stunt.

1378
01:40:30,442 --> 01:40:33,110
And, hey, judging from this crowd, that stunt is working.

1379
01:40:47,709 --> 01:40:49,126
We can't win, can we?

1380
01:40:50,211 --> 01:40:51,295
We'll see.

1381
01:40:55,383 --> 01:40:57,759
As the challenger makes his way into the arena,>>

1382
01:40:57,927 --> 01:40:59,887
you can hear the surge of excitement, Herb.

1383
01:41:11,816 --> 01:41:14,943
Atom has arrived onto the WRB scene with a vengeance,>>

1384
01:41:15,111 --> 01:41:17,821
using a style, some would call it human-like,>>

1385
01:41:17,989 --> 01:41:20,407
that bot fighting has rarely seen.

1386
01:41:20,575 --> 01:41:22,826
Atom and his pint-size trainer step into the ring>>

1387
01:41:22,994 --> 01:41:25,829
and the look on Farra Lemkova's face says it all.

1388
01:41:25,997 --> 01:41:27,789
Welcome to the bigs, junior!

1389
01:41:27,957 --> 01:41:30,918
I'm giving 1-to-5 odds that Atom don't make it out the first round.

1390
01:41:31,085 --> 01:41:33,086
Now who wants some?

1391
01:41:33,254 --> 01:41:34,588
I'll take some of that action.

1392
01:41:34,756 --> 01:41:38,926
Hey, there! I'll take some of that action.

1393
01:41:39,093 --> 01:41:42,221
How's it going... partner?

1394
01:41:42,388 --> 01:41:44,348
Partner?

1395
01:41:44,516 --> 01:41:47,434
That's great. How about a hundred K deep? Is that funny?

1396
01:41:47,602 --> 01:41:50,437
Hundred K says Atom doesn't see round two.

1397
01:41:50,605 --> 01:41:52,356
You carrying around that kind of scratch?

1398
01:41:53,525 --> 01:41:55,776
- Yeah. - Hundred K?

1399
01:41:56,611 --> 01:42:00,572
Tell you what. Remember section 101, row C>>

1400
01:42:00,740 --> 01:42:03,659
and you can bring me my money right to my seat.

1401
01:42:03,826 --> 01:42:06,995
101, row C? Hundred K?

1402
01:42:07,997 --> 01:42:09,039
You heard me, homey.

1403
01:42:09,207 --> 01:42:10,958
- Homey? - Right?

1404
01:42:11,125 --> 01:42:12,334
Homeboy!

1405
01:42:13,920 --> 01:42:16,213
All right. Peace out, posse.

1406
01:42:16,381 --> 01:42:17,589
Come on, sugar. Let's go.

1407
01:42:41,531 --> 01:42:43,031
Never beaten.

1408
01:42:43,199 --> 01:42:44,157
It's showtime!

1409
01:42:44,325 --> 01:42:46,535
Never threatened.

1410
01:42:46,703 --> 01:42:49,580
The king of the ring,>>

1411
01:42:49,747 --> 01:42:52,958
the ruler of robots!

1412
01:42:53,126 --> 01:42:58,422
Bow down to the mighty Zeus!

1413
01:43:24,032 --> 01:43:25,240
Oh, shit!

1414
01:43:31,789 --> 01:43:32,956
That was awesome.

1415
01:43:39,631 --> 01:43:40,797
Come on, let's go.

1416
01:43:47,221 --> 01:43:50,349
Ladies and gentlemen,>>

1417
01:43:50,516 --> 01:43:53,393
in a bout scheduled for five rounds>>

1418
01:43:53,561 --> 01:43:56,355
for the World Robot Boxing Championship,>>

1419
01:43:56,522 --> 01:44:00,400
in the corner to my right, the challenger, Atom!

1420
01:44:00,568 --> 01:44:01,652
Showboat!

1421
01:44:06,407 --> 01:44:08,784
And in the corner to my left,>>

1422
01:44:08,951 --> 01:44:12,079
the undeniable champion of this universe>>

1423
01:44:12,246 --> 01:44:15,540
and any other universe known or unknown,>>

1424
01:44:15,708 --> 01:44:20,128
the mighty Zeus!

1425
01:44:24,300 --> 01:44:27,219
And now, ladies and gentlemen,>>

1426
01:44:27,387 --> 01:44:28,720
are you ready>>

1427
01:44:28,888 --> 01:44:34,142
for Real Steel!

1428
01:44:36,813 --> 01:44:37,979
This is what it's all about!

1429
01:44:38,147 --> 01:44:42,234
There's the starting bell and we are underway.

1430
01:44:42,402 --> 01:44:45,028
The bots emerge from their corners.

1431
01:44:45,196 --> 01:44:48,073
Zeus decks Atom, and he is already down.

1432
01:44:48,241 --> 01:44:50,325
On your feet!

1433
01:44:50,493 --> 01:44:53,537
Looks like we are in for another Zeus clinic.

1434
01:44:54,789 --> 01:44:57,082
Referee Matt Geiger coming in the ring to start the count.

1435
01:44:58,084 --> 01:44:59,126
Get up!

1436
01:44:59,293 --> 01:45:00,502
...two, three...>>

1437
01:45:00,670 --> 01:45:04,214
Push up! Stand up!

1438
01:45:04,382 --> 01:45:07,050
But look at this. The little bot's back on his feet>>

1439
01:45:07,218 --> 01:45:10,303
to get a second blistering attack from Zeus!

1440
01:45:10,471 --> 01:45:12,806
And Atom is down for the second time in less than ten seconds.

1441
01:45:12,974 --> 01:45:16,435
- He's too strong! He's too strong! - That's my boy right there!

1442
01:45:18,438 --> 01:45:19,980
Get up and get in the game!

1443
01:45:20,148 --> 01:45:23,150
Come on! No, please Atom, get up! Please!

1444
01:45:23,317 --> 01:45:26,069
Get up! Get up! Get up!

1445
01:45:27,238 --> 01:45:30,198
Once again, the challenger finds his feet!

1446
01:45:31,617 --> 01:45:32,951
Lean back! Lean back!

1447
01:45:33,119 --> 01:45:35,078
Atom's getting pummeled into the corner!

1448
01:45:35,246 --> 01:45:37,497
- Get out of there, Atom! - Move, Atom, move!

1449
01:45:39,792 --> 01:45:41,835
A demolishing inside shot.

1450
01:45:42,003 --> 01:45:43,211
Get your hands up!

1451
01:45:45,214 --> 01:45:46,798
Hands up!

1452
01:45:47,592 --> 01:45:49,092
Crush that little can!

1453
01:45:49,260 --> 01:45:50,594
Get out of the corner! Get out of the corner!

1454
01:45:50,762 --> 01:45:52,929
Charlie Kenton desperately trying to command his robot>>

1455
01:45:53,097 --> 01:45:54,055
out of that suicide corner.

1456
01:45:54,223 --> 01:45:55,557
Cover up!

1457
01:45:58,436 --> 01:46:00,187
Get your feet under you!

1458
01:46:01,773 --> 01:46:03,774
Good night, sparring bot!

1459
01:46:03,941 --> 01:46:06,485
It might have taken Zeus a bit longer, but he's done it again!

1460
01:46:06,652 --> 01:46:10,071
Atom is down for the third and possibly final time tonight.

1461
01:46:10,239 --> 01:46:12,407
- Stand up! - Two!

1462
01:46:12,575 --> 01:46:15,368
- Three! - C'mon, Atom, get up!

1463
01:46:15,536 --> 01:46:17,704
- Get up, Atom. - Get up, Atom.

1464
01:46:17,872 --> 01:46:21,041
- Six! Seven! - Get up!

1465
01:46:21,209 --> 01:46:23,752
Eight! Nine!

1466
01:46:23,920 --> 01:46:26,630
I don't believe this! Against all odds,>>

1467
01:46:26,798 --> 01:46:28,632
this little bot is on his feet again.

1468
01:46:29,801 --> 01:46:30,842
Come on, Atom!

1469
01:46:34,055 --> 01:46:35,222
He can't survive this!

1470
01:46:39,018 --> 01:46:41,269
- Come on, Charlie! - Right uppercut!

1471
01:46:42,563 --> 01:46:45,315
Atom has landed a punch!

1472
01:46:45,483 --> 01:46:48,151
Zeus is stunned as he reels back from an uppercut>>

1473
01:46:48,319 --> 01:46:51,321
- that he clearly never saw coming! - Advance!

1474
01:46:52,198 --> 01:46:56,243
Fade back, counter right!

1475
01:46:56,410 --> 01:46:58,703
Right cross! Right cross!

1476
01:46:58,871 --> 01:46:59,621
Right cross!

1477
01:46:59,956 --> 01:47:00,747
Left hook!

1478
01:47:00,915 --> 01:47:03,792
- Let's go! Come on! - Take him down!

1479
01:47:03,960 --> 01:47:04,834
Double right to the body!

1480
01:47:05,002 --> 01:47:06,711
For the first time in his dominant run,>>

1481
01:47:06,879 --> 01:47:10,423
Zeus has met a bot who simply won't back down!

1482
01:47:12,385 --> 01:47:15,095
The crowd is going nuts! Zeus gives it everything he's got>>

1483
01:47:15,263 --> 01:47:18,014
as we reach the last 15 seconds of round one!

1484
01:47:18,182 --> 01:47:22,352
Zeus corners Atom, going double duty with both fists!

1485
01:47:22,520 --> 01:47:25,438
Downtown, uptown, as the clock winds down!

1486
01:47:25,606 --> 01:47:28,650
- Hands up, chin down. - Stay low, stay low!

1487
01:47:32,321 --> 01:47:35,532
Only five seconds left, as here comes that monster>>

1488
01:47:35,700 --> 01:47:37,284
piston-packed right of the champ!

1489
01:47:38,786 --> 01:47:42,872
There's the bell! I don't believe it. Somehow Atom has survived.

1490
01:47:43,040 --> 01:47:45,625
- He made it! - We will have a second round.

1491
01:47:45,793 --> 01:47:48,253
And the crowd here is thrilled!

1492
01:47:51,382 --> 01:47:53,300
He made it!

1493
01:47:53,467 --> 01:47:56,011
Yeah! Corner!

1494
01:47:56,178 --> 01:47:57,721
We got to get out of here, darling, come on.

1495
01:47:57,888 --> 01:47:59,931
We got to get out of here right now!

1496
01:48:02,685 --> 01:48:05,061
We got to go this way. Come on!

1497
01:48:10,568 --> 01:48:11,901
OK, you sit down.

1498
01:48:15,197 --> 01:48:17,657
- Let's go, homey. - All right.

1499
01:48:17,825 --> 01:48:19,451
I'll be back for you, baby.

1500
01:48:20,578 --> 01:48:22,495
Get your hands off me!

1501
01:48:25,374 --> 01:48:27,917
Both corners furiously working on their bots.

1502
01:48:28,085 --> 01:48:31,296
I tell you, Tim, this crowd came here tonight expecting a massacre>>

1503
01:48:31,464 --> 01:48:33,590
but instead they're getting a war!

1504
01:48:33,758 --> 01:48:35,133
- You got it? - Yeah.

1505
01:48:35,301 --> 01:48:38,553
- All right. Here we go. - What is happening?

1506
01:48:38,721 --> 01:48:41,931
He is fully prepared for all possible contingencies.

1507
01:48:42,099 --> 01:48:45,185
- He will be fine. - What next?

1508
01:48:46,103 --> 01:48:47,437
Round two.

1509
01:48:55,029 --> 01:48:57,238
Round two kicks off,>>

1510
01:48:57,406 --> 01:49:01,785
and incredibly the challenger, Atom, is giving the champ a run for his money.

1511
01:49:02,828 --> 01:49:06,539
Zeus tosses the smaller bot across the ring like a tin can!

1512
01:49:10,294 --> 01:49:12,545
Kenton working his bot with a trifecta>>

1513
01:49:12,713 --> 01:49:15,256
of straight rights to the champ's dome!

1514
01:49:20,346 --> 01:49:24,349
Toe-to-toe they stand, trading deafening blows!

1515
01:49:27,436 --> 01:49:31,106
Whatever strategy either corner had cooked up has been destroyed!

1516
01:49:33,943 --> 01:49:37,362
Metal bashing metal. Steel smashing steel.

1517
01:49:37,530 --> 01:49:40,365
This is a brawl!

1518
01:49:42,493 --> 01:49:43,993
The crowd is on their feet,>>

1519
01:49:44,161 --> 01:49:47,080
watching two machines driven to kill each other!

1520
01:49:47,248 --> 01:49:50,125
Something has to give, and it does!

1521
01:49:50,292 --> 01:49:52,043
Atom goes down again!

1522
01:49:52,211 --> 01:49:54,212
Lights out for the junkyard dog>>

1523
01:49:54,380 --> 01:49:56,339
who put on a heck of a show here tonight!

1524
01:49:58,509 --> 01:50:01,052
And yet again, Atom rises up.

1525
01:50:01,220 --> 01:50:05,682
Kenton must have hardwired this bot with the will to go on!

1526
01:50:12,148 --> 01:50:17,026
Midway through round four, and Zeus is looking to end this thing right now.

1527
01:50:17,194 --> 01:50:18,903
The champ is holding nothing back>>

1528
01:50:19,071 --> 01:50:21,114
as he cracks open the hurt locker!

1529
01:50:31,834 --> 01:50:33,585
Atom is stumbling around the ring,>>

1530
01:50:33,753 --> 01:50:35,545
apparently disoriented and dazed!

1531
01:50:35,713 --> 01:50:37,213
- Hands up! - What's going on?

1532
01:50:37,381 --> 01:50:38,757
I think the voice recog is shot!

1533
01:50:38,924 --> 01:50:40,091
- He's not responding! - What?

1534
01:50:43,429 --> 01:50:46,139
Zeus has found yet another gear of violence,>>

1535
01:50:46,307 --> 01:50:48,224
drilling Atom's midsection.

1536
01:50:48,392 --> 01:50:52,645
- No! Stop! Do something! - He can't hear me!

1537
01:50:54,190 --> 01:50:56,274
But the bell sounds, and once again,>>

1538
01:50:56,442 --> 01:50:59,110
this little robot has stunned the world!

1539
01:51:01,447 --> 01:51:04,115
We're done, Max! He can't hear me.

1540
01:51:04,283 --> 01:51:06,409
This is murder. We've had enough.

1541
01:51:06,577 --> 01:51:08,953
- I'm disabling the voice recognition. - So what? He can't hear me!

1542
01:51:09,121 --> 01:51:11,498
- Yes, but he can see you! - What?

1543
01:51:12,875 --> 01:51:15,585
I'm putting him in shadow mode. Show him what to do.

1544
01:51:15,753 --> 01:51:18,213
Without the voice recognition, he'll move even faster!

1545
01:51:18,380 --> 01:51:22,342
- No way. No way! - Look at them. They are freaking out!

1546
01:51:22,510 --> 01:51:24,344
Rich girl is ripping him a new one over there!

1547
01:51:24,512 --> 01:51:26,596
Do you know why? Because they're scared.

1548
01:51:26,764 --> 01:51:28,932
Because Atom can do things no other bot has ever done.

1549
01:51:29,099 --> 01:51:30,809
- But I can't do it! - Yes, you can.

1550
01:51:30,976 --> 01:51:34,187
- I can't, I can't. - Yes, you can.

1551
01:51:34,897 --> 01:51:38,441
Show him what to do. You have to fight the last round.

1552
01:51:38,609 --> 01:51:43,029
- Don't ask me. Don't. - Charlie... please.

1553
01:51:43,823 --> 01:51:45,490
I beg you.

1554
01:51:53,499 --> 01:51:54,958
Are you kidding me with those eyes?

1555
01:51:56,794 --> 01:52:00,088
- Damn it! - Yes!

1556
01:52:00,256 --> 01:52:02,674
I can't believe I'm doing this.

1557
01:52:02,842 --> 01:52:05,343
I know you're in there! I'm not sure if you're getting this or what,>>

1558
01:52:05,511 --> 01:52:06,761
but I know you're in there!

1559
01:52:06,929 --> 01:52:09,180
- Come on, Kenton. In or out? - In. Give me a minute.

1560
01:52:12,726 --> 01:52:17,522
I know you can't hear me, but you can see me, so watch me!

1561
01:52:17,898 --> 01:52:20,108
Watch... me.

1562
01:52:20,276 --> 01:52:23,820
- You know you're talking to a robot. - I know. Shut up.

1563
01:52:25,030 --> 01:52:26,698
Watch me.

1564
01:52:27,032 --> 01:52:28,950
An epic battle being waged here tonight,>>

1565
01:52:29,118 --> 01:52:31,244
as the fifth and final round gets underway.

1566
01:52:31,412 --> 01:52:33,079
Come on, Atom!

1567
01:52:42,715 --> 01:52:44,966
Wait a second, Herb. Are you seeing this?

1568
01:52:45,134 --> 01:52:48,219
Charlie Kenton is shadowboxing just outside the ring!

1569
01:52:48,387 --> 01:52:50,638
Tim, it looks like Atom has a shadow function.

1570
01:52:50,806 --> 01:52:53,433
So, basically, that means Charlie Kenton>>

1571
01:52:53,601 --> 01:52:56,561
is fighting the last round of this fight against Zeus.

1572
01:52:56,729 --> 01:52:58,938
Well, I tell you what, it doesn't seem to be much help,>>

1573
01:52:59,106 --> 01:53:01,190
because Atom is backed up against the ropes again.

1574
01:53:03,110 --> 01:53:04,944
Charlie, help him! Fight back!

1575
01:53:05,112 --> 01:53:06,362
Not yet.

1576
01:53:08,908 --> 01:53:13,536
Tak Mashido supervising personally as Zeus hammers down,>>

1577
01:53:13,704 --> 01:53:17,582
furiously trying to end this thing once and for all.

1578
01:53:17,750 --> 01:53:20,752
I got to tell you, folks, the champ looks tired.

1579
01:53:20,920 --> 01:53:23,212
This robot seems to be running on empty.

1580
01:53:27,009 --> 01:53:29,302
I don't believe it. Atom is taunting Zeus.

1581
01:53:29,470 --> 01:53:33,097
- Switch to turbo! - He's actually asking for more.

1582
01:53:35,017 --> 01:53:36,559
Please do something!

1583
01:53:36,727 --> 01:53:39,145
- Not yet. - That's right, Charlie. Not yet.

1584
01:53:41,857 --> 01:53:43,316
Nitrous pistons, now!

1585
01:53:46,445 --> 01:53:48,446
Charlie, he's not going to last much longer!

1586
01:53:48,614 --> 01:53:50,990
- Fight back! - Not yet.

1587
01:53:51,158 --> 01:53:52,408
Hang in there!

1588
01:53:52,576 --> 01:53:55,620
Atom is riddled with the nitrous-fueled>>

1589
01:53:55,788 --> 01:53:58,998
Gatling guns of Zeus's blows!

1590
01:53:59,166 --> 01:54:02,877
Atom! Atom! Atom! Atom!

1591
01:54:06,340 --> 01:54:08,549
Wait him out, wait him out! Not yet!

1592
01:54:11,136 --> 01:54:13,137
Zeus is slowing down!

1593
01:54:13,305 --> 01:54:16,057
Tim, the champ's power core is clearly depleted.

1594
01:54:16,225 --> 01:54:17,392
Charlie, please!

1595
01:54:19,645 --> 01:54:22,605
- Hey, kid. Now. - Now!

1596
01:54:28,445 --> 01:54:29,570
Get in there! Don't let him breathe!

1597
01:54:31,991 --> 01:54:34,283
Knock that little bitch! Bust him open!

1598
01:54:43,252 --> 01:54:44,544
Yeah! That's right!

1599
01:54:46,171 --> 01:54:47,422
Do something!

1600
01:54:48,298 --> 01:54:49,340
Move!

1601
01:54:50,843 --> 01:54:53,177
Override. Switching to manual.

1602
01:54:55,264 --> 01:54:57,974
In a shocking move, Tak Mashido is manually>>

1603
01:54:58,142 --> 01:55:00,018
operating his robot personally!

1604
01:55:10,571 --> 01:55:12,071
Work the body! Get inside him!

1605
01:55:12,239 --> 01:55:13,239
Get him, Atom!

1606
01:55:14,950 --> 01:55:17,326
Look at this! The champ is trying>>

1607
01:55:17,494 --> 01:55:21,330
desperately to stay on his feet but Kenton is relentless,>>

1608
01:55:21,498 --> 01:55:24,917
landing blow after blow after blow to the body!

1609
01:56:07,127 --> 01:56:09,295
Left! Right! Left! Right!

1610
01:56:09,463 --> 01:56:12,757
A huge uppercut by Atom!

1611
01:56:12,925 --> 01:56:14,759
Zeus is down!

1612
01:56:17,471 --> 01:56:20,473
- Yeah! - This little bot>>

1613
01:56:20,641 --> 01:56:25,394
has dug deep here tonight and shown something damn near heart!

1614
01:56:25,562 --> 01:56:29,690
One, two, three,>>

1615
01:56:29,858 --> 01:56:34,737
four, five, six, seven...>>

1616
01:56:34,905 --> 01:56:35,905
He's good!

1617
01:56:36,073 --> 01:56:37,240
Zeus gets to his feet.

1618
01:56:37,407 --> 01:56:39,575
But Kenton has Atom on him again,>>

1619
01:56:39,743 --> 01:56:42,245
landing punch after punch!

1620
01:56:42,412 --> 01:56:44,622
Tak Mashido and his super bot have no answer.

1621
01:56:44,790 --> 01:56:47,750
Zeus pins Atom's left arm, but Kenton is undaunted!

1622
01:56:47,918 --> 01:56:50,169
It all comes down to this, folks!

1623
01:56:50,337 --> 01:56:52,171
Drop him, Charlie! Now!

1624
01:56:52,339 --> 01:56:54,382
Kenton is about to drop the champ...>>

1625
01:56:54,550 --> 01:56:56,384
No! There's the bell!

1626
01:56:56,552 --> 01:56:59,303
Zeus is saved by the bell!

1627
01:57:04,101 --> 01:57:05,351
No!

1628
01:57:05,519 --> 01:57:08,521
Amazingly, Tim, we will go to the judges' cards!

1629
01:57:19,575 --> 01:57:21,701
Now, go on.

1630
01:57:22,035 --> 01:57:25,955
Ladies and gentlemen, after five rounds,>>

1631
01:57:26,123 --> 01:57:28,791
we go to the judges' scorecards.

1632
01:57:32,754 --> 01:57:37,175
Judge Number One scores the fight 47-48.

1633
01:57:37,342 --> 01:57:42,263
Judge Number Two scores the fight 48-46.

1634
01:57:42,431 --> 01:57:47,059
And Judge Number Three scores the fight 47-46>>

1635
01:57:47,227 --> 01:57:52,398
for the winner and still World Robot Boxing champion,>>

1636
01:57:52,566 --> 01:57:54,942
Zeus!

1637
01:58:00,282 --> 01:58:04,452
Farra... Farra... Farra Lemkova...>>

1638
01:58:04,620 --> 01:58:06,954
...you got way more than you bargained for tonight.

1639
01:58:07,122 --> 01:58:09,332
Some would say that your bot won the decision>>

1640
01:58:09,499 --> 01:58:11,083
but lost the fight.

1641
01:58:11,251 --> 01:58:12,627
Oh, she looks pissed.

1642
01:58:12,794 --> 01:58:15,421
It took a little longer than we thought,>>

1643
01:58:15,589 --> 01:58:18,925
but the result is as expected.

1644
01:58:19,760 --> 01:58:21,010
We won.

1645
01:58:21,803 --> 01:58:24,680
Zeus is still undefeated.

1646
01:58:27,434 --> 01:58:29,852
Tak... Tak Mashido... Tak...>>

1647
01:58:30,020 --> 01:58:32,855
Any comment on the absolutely humiliating near loss>>

1648
01:58:33,023 --> 01:58:34,649
your bot suffered tonight?

1649
01:58:37,653 --> 01:58:40,071
- Nothing. - No comment.

1650
01:58:40,239 --> 01:58:41,656
Max. Where's Max?

1651
01:58:41,823 --> 01:58:42,907
Max, let's go, go.

1652
01:58:45,369 --> 01:58:48,079
There he is. Max. Max.

1653
01:58:48,247 --> 01:58:52,291
They're already calling your bot "the people's champion.">>

1654
01:58:52,459 --> 01:58:54,961
Yeah!

1655
01:58:55,128 --> 01:58:57,088
Max, what do you say to that?

1656
01:58:58,048 --> 01:58:59,507
People's champion?

1657
01:59:02,094 --> 01:59:03,928
Sounds pretty good to me.

1658
01:59:09,393 --> 01:59:11,602
Dad? Dad!

1659
01:59:11,770 --> 01:59:14,021
Max! Max! Max!

1660
01:59:15,482 --> 01:59:16,649
- Max! - Dad!

1661
01:59:24,157 --> 01:59:27,410
Max... Max, I...>>

1662
01:59:27,577 --> 01:59:29,078
I really want you to know...>>

1663
01:59:29,246 --> 01:59:31,414
No, I need you to know.

1664
01:59:33,458 --> 01:59:34,542
Don't worry.

1665
01:59:36,086 --> 01:59:37,545
Your secret's safe with me.

1666
01:59:44,636 --> 01:59:46,178
Wait here. Wait here.

1667
02:00:00,068 --> 02:00:01,652
Up!

1668
02:00:08,618 --> 02:00:10,369
Yes!

1669
02:00:10,537 --> 02:00:12,330
Yeah!

1670
02:00:31,224 --> 02:00:34,727
- Yes! - Yeah!

1671
02:00:36,104 --> 02:00:38,272
Yeah!
