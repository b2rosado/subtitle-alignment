1
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,211
Don't worry about it.

2
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,802
On-- on my first day, I forgot everything that they taught me in those classes.

3
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,603
- Really? - Yeah.

4
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,046
I mean, day one's always a little tough.

5
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,889
It's like, you know, no matter how the training goes,>>

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,447
there's-- there's always room for something that's just totally unpredictable.

7
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,123
Oh, I-->>

8
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,728
I've got a pretty good story for you if you're ready for it.

9
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,006
- OK. - Hey, what's up?

10
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,411
- Hey. - Did you guys meet?

11
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,969
No. Nate.

12
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,002
- Hi. - Hey.

13
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,486
- Jessica. - OK, listen up.

14
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,768
So it's like my first week on the job, and I'm at gate duty, right?

15
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,961
What's that?

16
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,724
If a kid wants to leave, legally we can't stop them, so>>

17
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,808
we put someone at the gate to try and talk them out of it.

18
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,243
Whoa, you got here quick. I did.

19
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,163
Good morning. Hi.

20
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,928
Nate, this is Grace. She's your new boss.

21
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,203
Hello. Hey.

22
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,042
Hi, nice to meet you. Nice to meet you.

23
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,446
I would lose the tie if I were you.

24
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,289
And if you're listening to a story of Mason's, understand>>

25
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,686
that there's very little reality in it.

26
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:21,168
Hey, don't piss in the water before we put our toes in.

27
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,486
It actually feels pretty mellow.

28
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,722
OK, so Grace, my wonderful new boss>>

29
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,811
at the time, she leaves me at my gate duty for like three>>

30
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,081
hours without a bathroom break.

31
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,010
And I'm dying because I ate the tacos that they serve>>

32
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,088
here, and she failed to tell me that they're a known laxative.

33
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,768
So this kid, 16 years old, this big fuckin' intimidating>>

34
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,450
dude, he's like a foot taller than me.

35
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,769
He walks up and he just cruises out the gate.

36
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:49,808
It's my second day, so I don't know what the hell is going on.

37
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,527
But Grace, she's standing right there, and she just lets it happen.

38
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,323
Whatever.

39
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,805
What I saw was Mason just sitting there and Wesley>>

40
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,445
smiling at me from the opposite side of the gate>>

41
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,086
because he knows that we can't touch him.

42
00:01:59,200 --> 00:01:59,723
Why not?

43
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,490
Once they're a foot outside the gate, we can't touch them.

44
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:06,123
So Grace tells me to follow him, so I do for hours, just>>

45
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,685
walking eight feet behind him.

46
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,724
Eventually he gets on this bus, so I get on the bus too.

47
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,764
And at this point I can't think of anything but whatever>>

48
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,850
the hell these tacos are doing to my bowels.

49
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,371
Sol make up my mind, fuck this.

50
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,642
I've got to get off at the next stop or I'm going to lose>>

51
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,171
it in my shorts in front of all these people.

52
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,409
And exactly as I make this decision, Wesley leans his>>

53
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,205
big-ass head over to me from across the aisle, and he says,>>

54
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,722
really calm, I'm getting off at the next stop, and if you>>

55
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:36,688
do too, I'm going to rip your fuckin' balls off and feed them to you.

56
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,722
Holy shit. Remember what I said.

57
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,168
Hey now, this part is true. I was there.

58
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,802
- Really? Mm-hmm.

59
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,607
- Are you sure? - Yeah.

60
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,129
So the bus stops. He gets off.

61
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:46,809
I wait a second.

62
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,570
I go over to the door, but he's just standing there on>>

63
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:52,082
the sidewalk like 10 feet away, staring at me, waiting.

64
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,807
What can I do? I have no other choice.

65
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,921
So I step off the bus.

66
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,089
And the second that my feet touch the ground, it is like a>>

67
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:03,491
knot in my asshole untied, and the fiesta in my stomach just>>

68
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,648
comes pouring down my legs.

69
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,444
So I'm just standing there, shit gushing down my thighs.

70
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,767
I ruined my fuckin' favorite Nikes.

71
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,561
And Wesley is just there, doubled over, losing it.

72
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,126
And he's fuckin' laughing so hard. I've never seen anything-->>

73
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,921
Here we go, Nate. Wait, what?

74
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,206
Come on, Nate! Go.

75
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,367
Sammy!

76
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,165
Sammy!

77
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,089
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey.

78
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:38,005
Whoa, I got him. Let go, you fucking perverts!

79
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,051
OK. Nate, grab his feet, please.

80
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,628
Just going to sit down here in the grass for a while until you de-escalate.

81
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,085
De-escalate my asshole, you duck fuckers!

82
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,527
I'm not quite sure what you mean by that.

83
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,484
You know the drill, Sammy. Just let it pass.

84
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,969
You all right, buddy?

85
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,529
Whoa, he got pretty far that time. I think it's a new record.

86
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:09,402
So anyway, after all that he ends up coming back with me,>>

87
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:13,889
but only because he's so excited to tell everyone in our unit that I pooped my pants.

88
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,763
And he does. He tells everyone.

89
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,724
Somehow it even got back to my mom.

90
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:21,969
You heard that story, right Sammy?

91
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:22,603
Yeah.

92
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:25,329
How are you guys doing over there? Fantastic.

93
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,602
How are you feeling, Sammy? You got it all out?

94
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,006
You want to go take a nap? All right, let's get you up.

95
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,849
Up we go, bud.

96
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,446
All right, I'll see you back at the office.

97
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,322
, man. All right.

98
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,411
This guy's been eating his Wheaties in the morning.

99
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,286
Have you ever thought about the Olympics, Sammy?

100
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:53,403
Running track?

101
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,961
These are the files on our kids, if you want to see what>>

102
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,847
kind of crap they've been through. How long do they stay here?

103
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,486
Supposedly less than a year, but we have a few that have>>

104
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,601
been here a little over three.

105
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:34,965
We just keep them until the county figures out where they're going to go next.

106
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:35,803
Tom!

107
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,127
Go brush your teeth!

108
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,083
Mmm.

109
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,487
Remember, you are not their parent. You are not their therapist.

110
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,410
You are here to create a safe environment, and that's it.

111
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,043
Got it.

112
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,929
And since you're new, they're going to try and test you, see>>

113
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,964
what they can get away with. So just say no for a while.

114
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,963
No. OK.

115
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:57,289
Kind of got to be an asshole before you can be their friend.

116
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,685
You're going to be fine.

117
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,451
Community meeting is in five minutes!

118
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:07,564
- Luis, you better be up. - Ugh, I don't want to be.

119
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,008
So this is how it's going to be?

120
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,369
You've got five seconds.

121
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,049
Fuck!

122
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,970
Aah!

123
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:28,669
Luis!

124
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,844
I love you too.

125
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,281
That's not cool.

126
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,685
Kendra, will you be secretary for us today?

127
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,528
Sure, I guess.

128
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,290
OK, thank you.

129
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,724
Community meeting is now in session.

130
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,366
Community announcements?

131
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,441
No announcements?

132
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,289
What's going on, you guys?

133
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,643
You look a little dead.

134
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,769
What did you do to them? I don't know.

135
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,843
I farted when I was outside. Maybe some of it followed me in.

136
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:20,961
Did you shart yourself again?

137
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,368
No, Luis, I did not shart, thank you very much.

138
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:29,086
And that happened one time, and you weren't even here yet, so.

139
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,327
It's still funny. OK, are we done?

140
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,530
I've-- I've heard that story like three times today.

141
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,608
Yeah, but it's a good story. It is a good story.

142
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:39,326
OK, if no one has any non-poop related announcements, I have one.

143
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,490
As most of you are already aware, Marcus is turning 18>>

144
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,082
and will be leaving us. Can I have his room?

145
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,325
We are going to be throwing him a little party next week.

146
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,807
Marcus, any requests?

147
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,121
Can I shave my head? I was talking about food for the party.

148
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,042
No, I don't. I don't want food.

149
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,686
I want to shave my head.

150
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:14,006
OK. As long as I hold the razor.

151
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:14,643
Cool.

152
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,245
OK, everyone else, thoughts?

153
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,204
Food for Marcus' party, what are we going to do?

154
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,679
OK, OK.

155
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,011
Everyone, one at a time, please.

156
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:28,009
Luis, thank you for raising your hand. Who's the weird guy over there?

157
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,566
Oh, that is Nate.

158
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,807
Please do not be jerks to him. It is his first day.

159
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,723
Do you want to introduce yourself? Um, sure.

160
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,126
Great.

161
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,359
Yeah. Hey.

162
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,761
Uh, as you know, my name's Nate.

163
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,642
And, uh, I just-->>

164
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,047
I took a year off of school because, you know, I just>>

165
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,764
wanted to get some life experience.

166
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,850
And I always wanted to work with underprivileged kids.

167
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,530
Hey, what the fuck is that supposed to mean?

168
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,051
Marcus, settle down.

169
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,906
No, I want to know what you mean by that, "underprivileged.">>

170
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,048
That's not what I meant.

171
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,931
Then think about your fucking words before you speak!

172
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,161
Hey!

173
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,682
Newbie! That's a level drop.

174
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,484
Go to your room.

175
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,361
Go to your room.

176
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,963
Sorry, man.

177
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,809
Sorry.

178
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:27,724
Um, levels and feelings, you know the drill.

179
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,968
Let's start with you, Luis.

180
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,963
Green. Fine.

181
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,848
Silver. Whatever.

182
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,286
Yellow. I feel funny.

183
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,048
Green. All right.

184
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,770
Yellow. Annoyed.

185
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:46,530
Short Term 12, this is Grace.

186
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,289
Right now?

187
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,688
So what do you think?

188
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,044
Hmm? The new lamp.

189
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:58,968
It's really a trip.

190
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:02,004
You can turn it on and off by touching the metal part.

191
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,361
Try it.

192
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,843
Cool, huh? Hmm.

193
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,167
Look, I'm supposed to be in a group session like right now.

194
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,691
You mind if we walk and talk?

195
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,729
No. This is Jayden.

196
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,207
She just got appointed to us this morning.

197
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,724
Her father's a friend of a friend, real nice guy, very cultured.

198
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,444
Why isn't she with him?

199
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,042
Oh, he lost his wife a few years back.

200
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,491
Jayden hasn't made life very easy on him.

201
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,331
For the past couple of years, she's been in and out of group>>

202
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,125
homes for dangerous behavior.

203
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,961
Last week she bit her therapist's nose.

204
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:43,569
Great.

205
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:48,011
Yeah, so we'll have her during the week, but she gets weekend home visits.

206
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,443
All right.

207
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,841
I told her father we'd take good care of her.

208
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,648
I take good care of everyone. I know you do.

209
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:58,560
That's why I'm trusting you to do the same with Jayden.

210
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,922
When does she get here? She might be here already.

211
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,087
I like your name, Jayden.

212
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,929
It's a boy's name.

213
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,769
Really?

214
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:25,362
I don't think so. Will Smith did.

215
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,889
OK, well, these things you can't keep in your room, but>>

216
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,241
we'll keep them in the closet out here, and you can check>>

217
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,930
them out whenever you want them.

218
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:33,848
Yep, I know the rules.

219
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:38,045
No belts, no razors, no scissors, no fuckin' freedom.

220
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,570
No cussing. Shit, I forgot about that one.

221
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:47,721
I'm going to let that one slip because it was clever.

222
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,364
All right. Let's go see your room.

223
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,690
Here it is. Wow, it's so inviting.

224
00:12:55,800 --> 00:13:00,082
You can put whatever you want on the walls as long as it's appropriate.

225
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,043
So no pictures of penises?

226
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:07,121
Not unless it's very scientific.

227
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:10,001
Oh, wow. This is really cool.

228
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:13,363
No, that's crap.

229
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,967
If you call that crap, I'm jealous.

230
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,409
If you put your clothes outside the door before>>

231
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:26,366
bedtime, the overnighters will wash them.

232
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,929
And, um, you can't keep your door closest.

233
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:31,888
I don't do that anymore.

234
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,525
I'm not saying that you do.

235
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,165
I mean, even if I ever did want to cut myself, keeping>>

236
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,725
the fuckin' door cracked isn't going to stop me.

237
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,205
I already warned you about cussing.

238
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,004
That one's going to be a level drop.

239
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:43,606
Oh no, a level drop. What am I going to do?

240
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:48,044
Your attitude is not helping either one of us.

241
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:25,003
Hey, what happened to that guy? What guy?

242
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,964
The big kid that made you poop your pants.

243
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,369
Wesley. Yeah.

244
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:34,402
He ran away again, and then two days later someone found him dead in the bushes.

245
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,049
What?

246
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,288
That is the real ending to the story.

247
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,802
I don't like that part.

248
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,007
Sugar, coming with me? I'm going to clear my head.

249
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,084
That was a good first day, Nate. Thank you.

250
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,449
See ya. All right, man.

251
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,003
Yeah, take it easy. All right.

252
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,049
I'll see you tomorrow.

253
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,966
Grace?

254
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,162
Come on in, Hon.

255
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:24,250
So the test did come back positive.

256
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,088
Lovely.

257
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,771
How are you feeling?

258
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,603
I already did, like, seven of those tests at home,>>

259
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,463
so I'm not really surprised.

260
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:40,682
OK, well, you have a few options to explore.

261
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,767
And we can go over it for-->>

262
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,486
We can just make an appointment for Saturday.

263
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,968
You don't want to hear the other options?

264
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,601
Uh-uh.

265
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,963
OK.

266
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:02,766
Have you ever been pregnant before?

267
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,731
One time.

268
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,127
OK.

269
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:30,208
Hey, stinker, what took you so long?

270
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:30,838
Oh, no.

271
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,763
I didn't know you still had that stupid hat.

272
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,162
I will always have this stupid hat. What's going on in here?

273
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,487
Well, since you were out cheating on me with your bike,>>

274
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:41,689
I decided I'd make myself some chiles rellenos, homemade>>

275
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,724
tortillas, and my mom's famous salsa.

276
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,329
Mmm.

277
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,249
Looks like there's enough for two.

278
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,929
All right. I doubt it.

279
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:53,011
Mase, you don't have to be jealous of Floyd.

280
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,847
Floyd? Your bike has a name now?

281
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,847
Of course he does. We're very close.

282
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,406
I don't know what you see in him.

283
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,929
Mmm. Nice grip.

284
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:01,763
Comfy seat.

285
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:05,851
There is no way his seat is as comfy as mine.

286
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:06,728
You're right.

287
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:09,161
I think I'm going to go take a shower.

288
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,645
Floyd got me all sweaty.

289
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:14,287
I hate that bike!

290
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,482
Fuck you, Floyd.

291
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,171
OK, I'm done with mine.

292
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,247
On, yeah.

293
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:35,405
OK, yep. Almost there.

294
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,009
Um.

295
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,569
Those are some crazy last-minute changes you're making.

296
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:42,604
Yeah, well, I really suck at noses.

297
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,087
OK, you go first.

298
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,851
Aw, damn it.

299
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,247
Yours are always so good.

300
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:54,878
Thanks.

301
00:17:54,879 --> 00:17:58,123
I look like a homeless guy, though. You do kind of look like a homeless guy.

302
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,043
Oh yeah, thank you. What's that on my face there?

303
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,723
Oh, that? Yep.

304
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,409
Mmm.

305
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,881
Well, that's the piece of avocado that's in your beard.

306
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,129
No. Yes.

307
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,643
Oh, fuck. Yes.

308
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,649
It's been there the whole time. Ooh, yeah.

309
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,000
So now you're all nicely painted.

310
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,969
Thank you for saying something-- sooner>>

311
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,324
I did. I just-->>

312
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,922
OK. Um, all right, here we go.

313
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:22,323
Just take it easy, OK, because you're going to freak out when you see this.

314
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,681
I think it might be my best one yet.

315
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,451
OK.

316
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,726
Hmm? Come on.

317
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,561
Oh, wow. You can't fuck with that.

318
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:37,127
I can't fuck with that.

319
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,683
That nose is amazing. Yeah.

320
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,963
And I was going for kind of a mushroomy thing in there.

321
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,445
Is that a beard?

322
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,571
No. I was, uh-->>

323
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:49,087
I was trying to shade. I think it looks pretty cool.

324
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,009
Yeah, it looks very cool.

325
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,929
What's growing out of my head?

326
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,929
Oh, these? Flowers.

327
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:55,523
Mmm.

328
00:18:55,640 --> 00:19:00,408
They represent the peculiar thoughts that grow out of your gorgeous mind.

329
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,730
Why are you so nice to me?

330
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:13,451
You being serious now?

331
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,363
Mm-hmm. Well, it's easy.

332
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:19,485
It's because you are the weirdest, most beautiful>>

333
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:24,367
person that I've ever met in my whole entire life.

334
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,521
Whoa.

335
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,562
Hmm?

336
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,689
Um. Nothing.

337
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,560
It's just been a long time since you kissed me like that.

338
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,841
That's not true.

339
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:57,645
Well, we haven't had sex in 9 days and 13 hours.

340
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:03,288
Down to the hour, huh?

341
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,687
Did I do something?

342
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,846
No.

343
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,167
You're wonderful.

344
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,521
What is it, then?

345
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,525
Hey. Hey, hey.

346
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:22,166
Please, you have to let me in your head once in a while or>>

347
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,129
I'm just going to go nuts, OK?

348
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,248
Shh.

349
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,124
Are you doing this just for me?

350
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:48,967
You OK?

351
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:49,603
Yes.

352
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,563
Yeah?

353
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,967
You don't want me to stop?

354
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,489
Stop. Why?

355
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,068
Stop! Ow!

356
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,448
Shit.

357
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,487
What the hell, Grace?

358
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,648
OK, everyone.

359
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,650
I think most of you have already met her, but we have a>>

360
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,886
new member of our community.

361
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,721
Jayden, would you introduce yourself?

362
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,489
Please don't be offended if I'm not very friendly, but I'm>>

363
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,729
going to be living with my dad soon, and I don't really like>>

364
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,888
wasting time on short-term relationships.

365
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,403
So, you know, it's nothing personal.

366
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,043
Wow.

367
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,366
She seems like a really nice girl.

368
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,721
Hey, I think we all can respect her space, OK?

369
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,645
OK, what do we want to play for rec today?

370
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,642
Wiffle ball, dude!

371
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,569
OK. No, man.

372
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,045
You're always playing that stupid game.

373
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,366
Because you always suck at it.

374
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,963
Until you get good at it, maybe we could stop playing it.

375
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,570
- Watch your mouth, bro. - Both of you, cut it out.

376
00:22:55,680 --> 00:23:00,449
Any other suggestions? Yes, Sammy?

377
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,800
Can we play Big and Small?

378
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:05,322
Is that a real game, or is that a game you just made up?

379
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,091
It's a real game that I just made up.

380
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,723
OK.

381
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,923
Well, maybe you can explain that to me later.

382
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,362
Straight line, guys.

383
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,882
I'm going to do room checks, so I'll meet you.

384
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,650
Oh, OK.

385
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,809
Hi, Nas.

386
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,284
Come on, guys. Let's go, Shawnta, let's go!

387
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,324
All right, we got a baseball game.

388
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,922
There you go. You got this.

389
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,688
Sammy. Hey, yo, Sammy.

390
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,281
Get-- get the ball! Run, girl, run!

391
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,284
Come on, Sammy!

392
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:14,282
You too good for this game? What?

393
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,643
Too good for wiffle ball?

394
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,366
I don't like sweat.

395
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,051
Hey, you know what, Connor? Just come-- just come closer.

396
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,728
It's Marcus. He ain't going to hit it.

397
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,808
You sure you don't want to get the fat bat?

398
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,610
No?

399
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,165
Strike one, everybody.

400
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:31,849
Strike one.

401
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,200
That wasn't no strike. That was right down the middle.

402
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,084
This is the big leagues, boy. You can't handle it?

403
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,761
Better keep flapping them gums.

404
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,721
Hey. You want to jump rope with us?

405
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,161
Um.

406
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,487
No?

407
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,731
Sorry.

408
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,888
We're not supposed to.

409
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,161
That's not what we meant.

410
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,641
Can I hear?

411
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,923
Strike three. Change it up.

412
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:26,681
Bet your ma is real excited to see you next week, huh?

413
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,043
Marcus! What the fuck?

414
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,047
Hey!

415
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,003
What the fuck did you about my mama, you little bitch?

416
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,283
Hey! Hey!

417
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,247
What are you doing?

418
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,566
Get your ass over to the bench.

419
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,047
Come on, come on. Guys, get Luis out of here.

420
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,009
Is Marcus OK? You good?

421
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,528
Yeah, I got it. Luis, come on.

422
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,163
Come on.

423
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,730
OK, where-- where where-- where does it hurt?

424
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,767
Come on. Come on, sit over here.

425
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,450
We're going to sit down for a little while, OK?

426
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,969
You OK, man? How do you feel?

427
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,921
Not good. I mean, that-- that was crazy.

428
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:56,122
They just fight like that?

429
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:02,122
Nate, I'm not asking you how you're feeling.

430
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:02,809
Right.

431
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,081
I'm sorry.

432
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,567
How are you?

433
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:14,802
You need to tell me what the hell is going on.

434
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,769
 Assault and drug possession.

435
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,764
You realize that's enough to get your ass thrown in juvie.

436
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,008
Do you think I give a fuck?

437
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,329
You're out of here in less than a week.

438
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:48,883
You're so much smarter than this.

439
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:55,401
I know it's scary out there. I ain't scared of shit.

440
00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:01,846
All I'm saying is, getting thrown in jail is not what you>>

441
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,803
want to do.

442
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:17,922
My dad has been in there for 10 years.

443
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,930
I don't want that for you.

444
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,125
- Straight to your room. - No free time until all>>

445
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,248
your chores are done.

446
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,928
What's going on with him?

447
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,691
He doesn't want to leave.

448
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:54,210
Should I go talk to him?

449
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,242
Yeah.

450
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,762
All right, I'll just be inside letting Marcus kick the>>

451
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:02,968
shit out of me. Have fun.

452
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,766
You got some new lyrics you want to try out on me?

453
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,565
There's a lot of fucks in it.

454
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,808
I won't tell.

455
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,646
Mm-hmm. Those are pretty much it.

456
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:33,608
It's slow. All right, let's see.

457
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,882
Let's see here.

458
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,126
Like that?

459
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:46,009
Yeah. All right.

460
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,407
It don't matter now, damn near 18.

461
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:51,603
All the pretty pictures in my fuckin' head is faded.

462
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:54,963
And when I think about that trick that raised me, I think>>

463
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,606
about sick, because the bitch is crazy.

464
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,802
Fuck that bitch, nigga, fuck that pain.

465
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:02,082
Your body's in a ditch inside this turned up brain.

466
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,170
I mean, I can't see how you claim it, you being ma?

467
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:08,128
Doctors snatched me out the snatch of pure evil with eagle claws.

468
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,362
Ho, ho, ho, slut, fuck the way you want it.

469
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,245
Got your young, dumb son pitching pigeons for money.

470
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,886
I mean, it's colder than the bitch when it's sunny.

471
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,371
Blows raining down on the glow.

472
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,801
Got the nerve to tell me you love me?

473
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,529
I said, again? Again?

474
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,123
Sell it again? Bitch, I'm 10.

475
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,004
Let me go outside and function with friends.

476
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,849
You say you ma? You mother?

477
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:27,882
You the father-fucking queen?

478
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,764
I say, all right, I love her so I flip it again.

479
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:32,884
No, not this time, bitch, because I'm stronger than you.

480
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,002
Not this time, bitch, swinging harder than you.

481
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,805
No, not this time, bitch, you ain't leave me a choice.

482
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:41,083
You just a body in a ditch in the brain of a boy.

483
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,123
All fucked up now, damn near 18.

484
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:46,528
All the pictures in my past ain't never fading.

485
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:49,120
I'm always wishing for something amazing, but when>>

486
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,408
your life is shit then it ain't no trading.

487
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,524
So put me in your book so you know what it's like to live a>>

488
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,802
life not knowing what a normal life's like.

489
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:00,003
Put a label on my head so you know what it's like to live a>>

490
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,885
life not knowing what a normal life's like.

491
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,767
Look into my eyes so you know what it's like.

492
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:11,168
Look into my eyes so you know what it's like to live a life>>

493
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:15,080
not knowing what a normal life's like.

494
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,240
Yeah, I-- I don't-->>

495
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,966
I don't know what to say, man.

496
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:36,282
It's cool, man.

497
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,366
I just need to shave my head.

498
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:45,327
You think Grace will still shave it?

499
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,481
I like the new wall decor.

500
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,447
Thanks. They're actually very informative.

501
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,926
Can I draw with you?

502
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:25,369
When I was 9 or 10, I used to draw portraits of all my mom's>>

503
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,561
boyfriends.

504
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:30,526
And then I'd sell them to her for $10 apiece.

505
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:34,890
How many boyfriends did she have?

506
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,402
Enough that I was able to save up and buy one of those>>

507
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:44,129
portable CD players with anti-shock protection.

508
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,329
You're old. Whatever.

509
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,289
Those things were cool.

510
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,281
You know what's weird?

511
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,769
Whenever I was drawing portraits of, you know, those>>

512
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:03,329
guys, I would always take forever.

513
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,365
30, 40 minutes just stringing them along, saying, oh, I've>>

514
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:12,088
just got to do a couple more shadows, or, I'm>>

515
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,487
just fixing the nose.

516
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,889
I don't know why I did that.

517
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,925
I hated every single one of them.

518
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:27,410
Maybe you were just trying to keep them away from your mom.

519
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,168
Yeah.

520
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,368
Maybe.

521
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:44,523
Are you done? Almost.

522
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:48,202
I've just got to add a few shadows and fix the nose a little.

523
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:51,164
You are such a smartass.

524
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,691
That's a level drop.

525
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:55,889
Oh no, not a level drop.

526
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,207
I wanted to play foosball later.

527
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,810
Hmm.

528
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:02,605
Too bad.

529
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,571
OK.

530
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,808
Finished.

531
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:39,161
You want to take a look?

532
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:45,125
Looks great, Marcus.

533
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:47,368
Check it out.

534
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,848
Is it lumpy?

535
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,807
What do you mean?

536
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,726
I usually keep my hair long.

537
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:04,481
It's where she used to hit me at.

538
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,807
Is it still lumpy?

539
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:12,005
No way, man.

540
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,929
Not at all.

541
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,168
See for yourself.

542
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,522
Pretty smooth.

543
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,763
What about the back? No scars?

544
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,405
No-->>

545
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,649
no nothing? Uh-uh.

546
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:46,081
It looks really great.

547
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,890
Mason.

548
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,968
Hmm?

549
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,891
I have something to tell you.

550
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,804
Yeah?

551
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,008
What's up?

552
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:28,884
We're going to have a baby.

553
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,805
What?

554
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:45,491
We're going to have a baby.

555
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:51,009
We are?

556
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:54,043
Mm-hmm.

557
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:58,201
Whoa.

558
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,288
Whoa.

559
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,810
Whoa.

560
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,968
OK.

561
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,969
Um.

562
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,923
Um.

563
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,566
Um.

564
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,967
Uh, give me a minute.

565
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,843
Oh. boy!

566
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,325
Holy shit.

567
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:32,329
Whoa!

568
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:35,364
OK.

569
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,522
Hey.

570
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,925
You know we can do this, right?

571
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:58,807
Because we are going to be some amazing parents.

572
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,843
OK?

573
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,246
I love you so much, Grace.

574
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,446
So much it's insane.

575
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:29,802
Let me see. Hmm?

576
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,048
You can't tell yet.

577
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,367
Come on.

578
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,808
That is so crazy.

579
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,843
Hmm.

580
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:48,409
Did you hear about Sammy? What?

581
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:50,727
Last night they took all his dolls away.

582
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:56,250
His therapist is calling it a lesson in letting go.

583
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:56,883
Bullshit.

584
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,800
Those are all his sisters, right?

585
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:03,491
He's not ready for that.

586
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:11,567
It's time for your meds, Sammy.

587
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:27,641
I'm sorry, bud.

588
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,849
Jayden, meds.

589
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:41,049
How'd you sleep? Like crap.

590
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:44,323
Can you tell the doctor I need a higher dosage of Trazodone?

591
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:47,370
Mm-hmm, I will tell him.

592
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:51,526
Happy birthday.

593
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:59,170
And it comes with this.

594
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,601
Mason made that.

595
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,969
Thanks.

596
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:08,845
I heard your dad's picking you up.

597
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:15,447
Yep. You excited?

598
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,287
Whatever.

599
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:58,443
Dan, you have a visitor at the front gate.

600
00:42:58,560 --> 00:42:59,447
Dan to the front gate.

601
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:04,168
The barber of Seville!

602
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,331
Bye, Shawnta.

603
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:20,327
Bye. Bye, Shawnta.

604
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:22,647
Bye-bye.

605
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,800
To encounter so many sharks can be-->>

606
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,282
The fact that this occurs on the eve of>>

607
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:53,200
the summer solstice left me wondering.

608
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:56,564
Damn it. Will you watch the kids?

609
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:57,203
Sure.

610
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:59,800
Nate.

611
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:08,526
Jayden.

612
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:13,288
Come on, you know you can't keep the door closed.

613
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:15,129
Stop pushing on the door.

614
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:16,889
Hey. Hey, Jade.

615
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,604
I'm really sorry about your dad.

616
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,689
Why can't she close her door? She's a cutter.

617
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,325
I can fucking hear you, dick!

618
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,922
Maybe I'll just cut myself right now, and you'll all lose your fucking jobs!

619
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:25,768
Come on, Jade.

620
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:28,168
Don't fucking call me Jade, you bitch!

621
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,047
Jayden, come on. Please, just open the door.

622
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:37,965
If you just open the door, then we won't bother you anymore.

623
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:41,088
If you're not going to open the door, then we're going to>>

624
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:41,883
have to force it.

625
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,122
Can you help me?

626
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:44,889
Yeah, yeah.

627
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,047
Yeah.

628
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,810
OK.

629
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:49,648
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

630
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:53,401
Get the fuck out of my room, you fucking-->>

631
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:54,288
stop touching me!

632
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:55,970
All right, easy, easy, easy.

633
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:57,809
One, two, three, down.

634
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:59,729
Ah, fuck you!

635
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:02,844
Luis, sit down.

636
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:07,928
You're fucking squishing me, you fatass!

637
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:09,963
Sorry, how's that?

638
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:10,723
Let me go!

639
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:13,522
You shouldn't be here, Grace. What's wrong, Mason?

640
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:15,688
Can't handle me for yourself, you weak-ass fuck?

641
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:18,007
Need the bitch to do it for you?

642
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:19,281
Hold her good, Nate.

643
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:22,051
Yeah, hold me good, Nate.

644
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:25,049
Sorry, man.

645
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:31,291
You're going to be OK, Jayden. It's going to be OK.

646
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:33,129
I hate you.

647
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:37,643
I hate you. That's fine.

648
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:40,240
You don't have to like me right now.

649
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,767
Just let it pass.

650
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:46,248
How we doing, Nate?

651
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:50,043
Not so good. You're doing good.

652
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:52,726
You're doing really good.

653
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:03,767
Grace, how's my cupcake?

654
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:09,689
The ancient islands are cold.

655
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:12,522
How is she? I guess she's in the cool-down room now.

656
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:14,762
I need that.

657
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:18,528
Common gray seals can be found here in abundance.

658
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:24,170
In fact, Scotland is home to 40% of the world's gray seal>>

659
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:26,647
population.

660
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:29,842
Everybody grab one.

661
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:33,602
Come on.

662
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:57,811
You want to see mine?

663
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:08,205
Shit.

664
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:11,045
That one's from a sneeze.

665
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:13,845
Slipped and cut too deep.

666
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:16,850
Almost cut my achilles.

667
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:21,242
Why?

668
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:23,328
Hmm.

669
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:27,601
My mom died.

670
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:32,127
I went to live with my dad and-->>

671
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:37,927
it's impossible to worry about anything else when there's>>

672
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:40,281
blood coming out of you.

673
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:59,247
God, I hate that thing.

674
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:12,003
Me too.

675
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:38,611
Take as much time as you need.

676
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:03,847
Happy birthday to you!

677
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:09,002
Blow them out! Blow them out!

678
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:10,360
Go!

679
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:12,445
Jayden!

680
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:16,286
Jayden!

681
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:30,563
Ah, big booty, big booty, big booty!

682
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:32,011
Big booty number four.

683
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:34,571
- Number four, number five. - Number five, number six.

684
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:37,005
- Number six, number five. - Number 5, number 10.

685
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:38,201
Number seven, big booty.

686
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:40,368
Big booty, number 10.

687
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:41,925
Aw!

688
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:44,964
Come on, she works here.

689
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:46,206
She should be embarrassed.

690
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:48,049
I am embarrassed.

691
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:50,282
Hey, it's OK. It happens to all of us.

692
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:52,010
Let's go for another round Ready?

693
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:58,082
Ah, big booty, big booty-->>

694
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:29,805
Hmm, slow this down a little bit.

695
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,002
Yo, y'all ain't got no rhythm, man.

696
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:32,882
Tell me about it.

697
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,206
I'm trying to keep them in line.

698
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:35,521
It's just so hard.

699
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:37,529
Mase, I love you like a brother but I got to>>

700
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:40,962
say that when it come to being discreet, you're a disgrace.

701
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:44,448
I mean, he think we all don't know about him and Grace on>>

702
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:47,564
the low undercover trying to date.

703
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:52,130
I don't know what you're talking about.

704
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:54,766
Uh, I'm out the gate, right?

705
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:55,443
My name is Nate.

706
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:59,884
When I came here, y'all tried to player-hate.

707
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,321
Everyone sit down, please.

708
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:11,568
We have an AWOL.

709
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:16,206
Jayden!

710
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:18,725
Grace! Stay with the kids!

711
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:20,968
I'll call you when I get her.

712
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:30,167
This happens. It's fine.

713
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:32,681
Jayden!

714
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:34,723
Jayden, can you slow down, please?

715
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:36,120
I feel like I'm going to barf.

716
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:38,083
Keep-- keep the same distance.

717
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:39,087
Stop!

718
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,843
OK. OK.

719
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:47,242
You can't touch me outside of the grounds.

720
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,651
Well, can I walk with you?

721
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:55,401
Walk all you want, but I'm not going back there.

722
00:52:57,160 --> 00:52:59,401
Let's walk, then.

723
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:15,680
Jayden, you know you're not supposed to be here.

724
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:26,561
Hey. Um, we're at her dad's house.

725
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:31,447
I don't think that anyone's here, but she went in anyway.

726
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:33,642
OK, thanks.

727
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:53,642
He's not home?

728
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:05,447
Do you want to go back?

729
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:14,009
OK.

730
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:36,442
You OK?

731
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:41,807
I'll see you tomorrow.

732
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:48,208
You want to hear a story I've been working on?

733
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:50,442
Of course.

734
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:03,164
Well, it's a kid's story, so there aren't any big words.

735
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:05,282
OK.

736
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:07,926
Once upon a time, somewhere miles and miles beneath the>>

737
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:11,567
surface of the ocean, there lived a young>>

738
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:13,802
octopus named Nina.

739
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:18,130
Nina spent most of her time alone making strange creations>>

740
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:22,645
out of rocks and shells. And she was very happy.

741
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:26,731
But then on Monday the shark showed up.

742
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:29,650
"What's your name?" said the shark.

743
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:31,000
"Nina," she replied.

744
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:34,886
"Do you want to be my friend?" he asked.

745
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:35,523
"OK.

746
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:38,649
What do I have to do?" said Nina.

747
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:40,091
"Not much," said the shark.

748
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:43,727
"Just let me eat one of your arms.">>

749
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:46,923
Nina had never had a friend before, so she wondered if>>

750
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:49,725
this was what you had to do to get one.

751
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:53,441
She looked down at her eight arms and decided it wouldn't>>

752
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:54,686
be so bad to give up one.

753
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:59,442
So she donated an arm to her wonderful new friend.

754
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:02,683
Wow.

755
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:05,565
Every day that week, Nina and the shark would play together.

756
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:10,049
They explored caves, built castles of sand, and swam>>

757
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:11,605
really, really fast.

758
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:14,929
And every night the shark would be hungry, and Nina>>

759
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:18,681
would give him another one of her arms to eat.

760
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:26,648
On Sunday, after playing all day, the shark told Nina that>>

761
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:28,524
he was very hungry.

762
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:30,005
"I don't understand," she said.

763
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:33,310
"I've already given you six of my arms, and now you want one more?">>

764
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:37,728
The shark looked at her with a friendly smile and>>

765
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:39,763
said, "I don't want one.

766
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:46,570
This time I want them all." "But why?" Nina asked.

767
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:51,568
And the shark replied, "because that's what friends are for.">>

768
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:59,322
When the shark finished his meal, he felt>>

769
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:00,885
very sad and lonely.

770
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:05,085
He missed having someone to explore caves, build castles,>>

771
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:08,522
and swim really, really fast with.

772
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:14,890
He missed Nina very much.

773
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:19,366
So he-- he swam away to find another friend.

774
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:35,411
Jayden?

775
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:40,411
Did your dad ever hurt you?

776
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:51,561
Does he still hurt you?

777
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:34,361
We can't let her go back there.

778
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:41,571
That's not going to happen.

779
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:49,720
You were pretty amazing today.

780
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:50,841
Thank you.

781
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:30,964
Hmm?

782
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:35,925
More, please.

783
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:37,728
More for everyone. More of everything.

784
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:39,842
Anyone, dessert first?

785
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:43,131
Dessert? Dessert first?

786
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:44,884
Excuse me, excuse me.

787
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,047
Hello, hello.

788
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:47,763
Hi. Um.

789
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:48,403
Ahem.

790
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:55,244
But I'm going to say it in English so I don't embarrass>>

791
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:57,647
myself any more than I need to.

792
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:01,765
Uh, I just want to take a moment to say>>

793
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:04,531
thank you, Mama, Pops.

794
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:10,130
I don't think anyone here thinks of you as just our>>

795
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:11,571
foster parents.

796
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:14,809
I don't even know what that term means because to me,>>

797
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:17,810
you're just Ma and Pa.

798
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:22,721
And I think I speak for everyone here when I say,>>

799
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:25,081
thank you for taking us in.

800
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:29,245
For taking me in when I was just a punk kid who was scared>>

801
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:31,727
of everything.

802
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:36,925
When I had no one else, you accepted me and you showed me>>

803
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:39,008
what it was like-->>

804
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:45,686
um, what it was like to be loved.

805
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:51,170
And none of us would be here if it weren't for you.

806
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:55,365
Just look at this beautiful family you made.

807
01:01:55,520 --> 01:02:00,242
So let's all lift our glasses to our king and queen.

808
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:01,811
Happy 30th, you guys.

809
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:05,606
Everything good in my life is because of you.

810
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:06,243
Salud.

811
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:07,885
Salud!

812
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:20,766
Will you marry me?

813
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:28,049
You're serious? Yeah.

814
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:30,322
I'm dead serious.

815
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:06,408
Mmm.

816
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:11,966
Who the hell is calling on the land line?

817
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:21,202
Hello?

818
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:24,603
Yeah.

819
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:27,041
This is, uh, actually her, uh, fiance.

820
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:30,767
And if this is about her dad, it'd probably be best if you>>

821
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:33,565
just let me relay the message.

822
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:38,082
Mm-hmm.

823
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,968
Oh, shit.

824
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:52,686
Who was it?

825
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:53,722
Um.

826
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:57,970
That was someone from the probation department.

827
01:04:58,120 --> 01:05:02,125
They said that your dad's probably going to get released>>

828
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:04,322
next month.

829
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:00,309
Hey.

830
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:02,084
I really think we need to talk through some of this stuff.

831
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:04,328
Not right now, Mason.

832
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:06,003
I'll be fine. I just-->>

833
01:06:06,120 --> 01:06:08,646
I just need to work.

834
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:14,969
Hey. Hi.

835
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:18,163
Marcus' fish died last night.

836
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:19,406
What?

837
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:24,447
He thinks Luis had something to do with it.

838
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:26,483
Did he?

839
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:36,406
Tell me you didn't do something to Marcus' fish.

840
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:37,968
What? Luis, tell me.

841
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:40,845
I don't know what you're talking about.

842
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:44,683
I swear!

843
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:56,561
I'm really sorry, Marcus.

844
01:07:00,360 --> 01:07:02,886
It wasn't Luis.

845
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,162
It don't matter.

846
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:12,881
I'd like to be left alone, if that's cool with you.

847
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,923
OK.

848
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:18,889
Just let me know if you need anything.

849
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:38,002
Have you guys seen Jayden?

850
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:40,122
Uh-uh.

851
01:07:44,280 --> 01:07:45,528
Jess? Where's Jayden?

852
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:49,610
Oh, her dad showed up last night and took her on pass for the weekend.

853
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:51,805
What? Jack signed off on it.

854
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:54,611
Are you fucking kidding me?

855
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:00,641
How could you let her go?

856
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:05,203
Uh, Jan, let me call you right back, OK?

857
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:07,249
The man called. He apologized.

858
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:08,850
He had a personal emergency.

859
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:12,087
That's not even the point, Jack. Did you read my report?

860
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:13,964
Of course I did, and I was very concerned.

861
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:17,004
But when Jayden's social worker asked her about it, she>>

862
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:20,329
said her father had never been abusive in any way.

863
01:08:20,440 --> 01:08:21,566
Of course she said that.

864
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:22,567
She's fucking scared!

865
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:25,490
What the fuck did they teach you guys in grad school?

866
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:29,880
Jack, in her mind he is always right behind her, watching her.

867
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:31,887
When she is sleeping. When she is taking a shit.

868
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:34,930
When she is alone with her therapist, he is right there>>

869
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:36,121
watching her, ready to pounce.

870
01:08:36,240 --> 01:08:39,050
And you just expect her to just come out and say it?

871
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:40,082
Are you guys fucking stupid?

872
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:42,806
Because she was here asking for help, and you just send>>

873
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:44,410
her back to the fucking shark.

874
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:46,488
I realize you're upset, Grace.

875
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:49,564
But yelling at me isn't an effective form of>>

876
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:51,808
communication.

877
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:54,121
OK.

878
01:08:54,240 --> 01:08:58,083
OK, Jack. Jack, I'm sorry.

879
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:01,443
Please cancel the pass until we figure this out, because I>>

880
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:05,565
know her and I know that things are not good at home.

881
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:06,702
And how do you know that?

882
01:09:06,720 --> 01:09:08,563
Because she read you a children's story?

883
01:09:08,680 --> 01:09:09,681
Don't fuck with me, Jack.

884
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:11,529
I am on the floor every day with those kids.

885
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:14,723
And last night, that girl sat next to me and she cried, and>>

886
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:18,049
she tried to tell me the only way that she knew how.

887
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:21,050
Grace, you are a line staff.

888
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:23,401
It's not your job to interpret tears.

889
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:25,045
That's what our trained therapists are here for.

890
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:27,686
Then your trained therapists don't know shit.

891
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:31,327
Did she tell you that she was being abused by her father?

892
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:32,348
She didn't have to.

893
01:09:32,360 --> 01:09:35,170
If I'm going to take that child away from her biological>>

894
01:09:35,280 --> 01:09:38,410
parent, yes, she does.

895
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:40,248
This is bullshit.

896
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:45,048
Grace, I have been working with these kids longer than you've been alive.

897
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:48,761
And there's not one of them that I wouldn't die for.

898
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:49,881
I look into those broken eyes.

899
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,924
I want to go out and find the asshole who did that to them>>

900
01:09:53,080 --> 01:09:54,081
and beat the shit out of them.

901
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:58,205
But although I feel that way every single day, I know I>>

902
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:00,163
can't track down everyone who's hurt them.

903
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:03,090
I know I can't heal all their wounds, and I can't start>>

904
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:08,445
accusing all their parents of being sexual offenders.

905
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:12,782
Especially when they're friends of friends, right, Jack?

906
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:16,085
We're finished here, Grace.

907
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:25,808
Jan-->>

908
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,968
Sam.

909
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,367
Marcus?

910
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:24,842
Marcus?

911
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:29,449
Marcus?

912
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:31,722
What are you doing in Luis' room?

913
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:38,762
Oh, no.

914
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:42,769
Luis?

915
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:44,968
Luis!

916
01:12:45,080 --> 01:12:49,963
What? No.

917
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:51,209
Shit. Shit!

918
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:53,843
Mason! Somebody, anybody come!

919
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:55,643
Help me! Luis!

920
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:58,770
Luis, I need your pillowcase right now. Give it to me.

921
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:02,247
Quicker, please. Marcus?

922
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:03,962
Marcus. Marcus, please look at me.

923
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:05,842
Marcus, look at me. You're going to be OK.

924
01:13:05,960 --> 01:13:08,611
I just need you to look at me.

925
01:13:08,720 --> 01:13:11,724
Marcus, look at me.

926
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:14,684
What the fuck is taking so long?

927
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:25,406
Now I have a real friend.

928
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:32,209
I'm going to call you, uh, Dudley.

929
01:13:52,160 --> 01:13:53,571
Dr. Stone-->>

930
01:13:53,680 --> 01:13:55,842
Blake Johnson, dial 93, please.

931
01:13:55,960 --> 01:13:58,566
Blake Johnson, dial 93.

932
01:14:01,680 --> 01:14:04,524
They still don't know anything.

933
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:17,086
I can't do this.

934
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:23,369
Grace. Hey.

935
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:24,521
Grace, where are you going?

936
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:26,722
I can't do this.

937
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:29,843
OK, let's go. Let's go.

938
01:14:29,960 --> 01:14:31,007
I'll drive us home.

939
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:32,360
Don't want to go home.

940
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:35,882
That's not what I'm talking about.

941
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:37,764
I know it's been a really fucked up day, OK?

942
01:14:37,880 --> 01:14:43,125
Mason, you have no idea what I'm going through right now.

943
01:14:43,240 --> 01:14:46,482
Then tell me. That's how this works.

944
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:48,921
You talk to me about it so that I can take your hand and>>

945
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:51,168
fucking walk through this shit with you.

946
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:53,009
That is what I signed up for, OK?

947
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:57,967
But I cannot do that if you won't let me in.

948
01:15:01,160 --> 01:15:03,367
I can't.

949
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,287
I'm sorry.

950
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:13,603
You're sorry?

951
01:15:13,720 --> 01:15:15,882
Grace, are you serious?

952
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,731
I've been waiting for you for a really long time, and I>>

953
01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:22,049
wouldn't take a second of it back because I love you so>>

954
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:23,406
goddamn much, OK?

955
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:26,842
But I have been waiting for three years for you to tell me>>

956
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:28,968
why you still don't trust me.

957
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:31,481
I've been waiting for three years for you to just once>>

958
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:34,001
take the advice that you give your kids every fuckin' five>>

959
01:15:34,120 --> 01:15:37,044
minutes and learn to talk about what's going>>

960
01:15:37,160 --> 01:15:39,367
on inside your head.

961
01:15:39,480 --> 01:15:41,801
You can't do that for me?

962
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:48,724
Whatever it is, OK, just talk to me.

963
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:54,800
But I can't do this.

964
01:16:00,240 --> 01:16:01,048
I can't-->>

965
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:03,646
I can't marry you.

966
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:05,000
I can't have your baby.

967
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:07,731
I can't have any of it.

968
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:16,647
I can't do it.

969
01:16:26,160 --> 01:16:28,606
So what do you want to do?

970
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:34,403
Hmm?

971
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:41,728
Do you want to get an abortion?

972
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:44,764
I already made the appointment.

973
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:06,761
Do whatever you want, OK?

974
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:08,769
Because I'm done.

975
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:07,802
Kids don't care nothing about it.

976
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:15,163
Ed, do you want some vittles today?

977
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:16,611
I do, Granny.

978
01:19:16,720 --> 01:19:19,688
I worked up a right smart appetite fetching sticks for old Duke.

979
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:21,962
Yes, that's the trouble around here.

980
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:23,525
The critters are taking over.

981
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:28,369
Billie Mae has done made pets out of everything but my pickled turnips.

982
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:30,164
What are we going to do for vittles?

983
01:19:30,280 --> 01:19:33,010
Wait, I remember someplace to drive near-->>

984
01:19:44,240 --> 01:19:47,210
What are you doing?

985
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:51,643
That's a little extreme, don't you think?

986
01:20:14,360 --> 01:20:16,886
Are you going crazy?

987
01:20:20,440 --> 01:20:22,727
Probably.

988
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:35,727
When I was your age, I had to stand in a courtroom with a>>

989
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:40,084
bunch of strangers and tell them all the ways>>

990
01:20:40,200 --> 01:20:42,441
that he abused me.

991
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:47,646
What he hit me with.

992
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:51,008
How he got drunk.

993
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:55,881
How he forced me to take a shower with him.

994
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:03,202
Got me pregnant.

995
01:21:08,080 --> 01:21:10,367
I sent him to prison.

996
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:16,885
I didn't talk about it.

997
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,480
I didn't think about it.

998
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,082
Until I met you.

999
01:21:30,040 --> 01:21:31,929
And I don't know.

1000
01:21:33,880 --> 01:21:37,930
I have a baby inside of me, and I don't know.

1001
01:21:38,040 --> 01:21:40,805
I don't know what I'm doing.

1002
01:21:49,320 --> 01:21:52,403
I was just trying to help you.

1003
01:22:05,320 --> 01:22:07,971
Oh my god.

1004
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:11,004
He loves the belt.

1005
01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:12,485
It's such a cliche.

1006
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:15,490
Jayden, we have to do something about this.

1007
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:18,171
Should go bash his face in with a baseball>>

1008
01:22:18,280 --> 01:22:20,521
bat while he's sleeping?

1009
01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:02,129
Uh, we should get out of here.

1010
01:23:02,240 --> 01:23:04,925
He'll sleep through anything.

1011
01:24:09,160 --> 01:24:12,600
OK. Now we should get out of here.

1012
01:24:40,760 --> 01:24:44,128
They're going to ask you a lot of questions.

1013
01:24:44,240 --> 01:24:46,720
It's going to be hard.

1014
01:24:46,840 --> 01:24:48,842
I'll try to leave out the part about you breaking into>>

1015
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:51,884
that house with a baseball bat.

1016
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:56,289
Thanks.

1017
01:24:56,720 --> 01:25:00,008
You're going to be a really good mom.

1018
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:10,601
I told him this was going to be the last time I came home.

1019
01:25:12,720 --> 01:25:15,769
Because I'm not going to take his shit anymore.

1020
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:21,128
And that set him off, of course.

1021
01:25:23,400 --> 01:25:25,641
But I didn't care.

1022
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:55,322
I'm sorry.

1023
01:25:56,040 --> 01:25:59,328
I didn't mean what I said earlier.

1024
01:26:00,480 --> 01:26:03,882
I'm just really messed up right now.

1025
01:26:28,200 --> 01:26:30,851
Marcus is going to get better.

1026
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:36,527
I think I am too.

1027
01:26:51,680 --> 01:26:56,242
Grace, I know talking like this is really hard.

1028
01:26:56,360 --> 01:27:01,651
But this is our fourth session together, and I'd really like>>

1029
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:03,922
you to try, OK?

1030
01:27:09,160 --> 01:27:12,289
I don't really know what to say.

1031
01:27:13,720 --> 01:27:15,882
Your dad's getting out of prison in a week.

1032
01:27:16,040 --> 01:27:19,328
Do you want to talk about that?

1033
01:27:28,280 --> 01:27:30,442
OK.

1034
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:54,929
Are you OK?

1035
01:27:55,080 --> 01:27:57,003
Mm-hmm.

1036
01:28:00,240 --> 01:28:03,403
Watch that monitor over my shoulder.

1037
01:28:04,760 --> 01:28:07,127
I think he's-- there we go.

1038
01:28:07,240 --> 01:28:09,322
There he is.

1039
01:28:12,920 --> 01:28:15,768
Stay with it. Hang on a second.

1040
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:19,809
Hang on.

1041
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:23,447
That's-- that's the baby's heartbeat, man.

1042
01:28:23,560 --> 01:28:25,483
Oh, man.

1043
01:29:06,640 --> 01:29:11,328
So you need to get ready for this because it's so fucking>>

1044
01:29:11,440 --> 01:29:12,009
unbelievable.

1045
01:29:12,120 --> 01:29:14,282
It's going to seem fake, but I promise you it's not.

1046
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:16,726
Grace will vouch for it. It depends if you tell it right.

1047
01:29:16,840 --> 01:29:18,490
There is no way not to tell this right.

1048
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:20,602
It is a storyteller's wet dream.

1049
01:29:20,720 --> 01:29:22,647
What? Get ready for this.

1050
01:29:22,760 --> 01:29:25,485
OK, just in time. I'm going to start at the beginning, OK.

1051
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:26,169
OK.

1052
01:29:26,280 --> 01:29:28,648
So three years ago, right, we have this girl here named Liza Green.

1053
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:31,849
She's 17, older than everybody else on the unit at the time.

1054
01:29:31,960 --> 01:29:35,203
And I don't mean this in a pervy way or anything, but>>

1055
01:29:35,320 --> 01:29:36,321
she's real pretty.

1056
01:29:36,440 --> 01:29:37,202
She was gorgeous.

1057
01:29:37,320 --> 01:29:39,561
All the guys on the unit want her, but she won't give any of>>

1058
01:29:39,680 --> 01:29:41,648
them the time of day because she was busy.

1059
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:43,761
She was always studying. She was very smart.

1060
01:29:43,880 --> 01:29:45,208
Mm-hmm. Really smart.

1061
01:29:45,320 --> 01:29:48,928
So two weeks before she turns 18 and leaves, we get this new intake.

1062
01:29:49,040 --> 01:29:51,802
It's a 15-year-old guy. He's really tough.

1063
01:29:51,920 --> 01:29:53,563
He's really quiet. But he's cool.

1064
01:29:53,680 --> 01:29:55,569
He's just kind of like kicking back, checking out the scene.

1065
01:29:55,680 --> 01:30:00,523
And I swear I didn't hear him say a word the whole first week he was here.

1066
01:30:00,640 --> 01:30:04,602
But then one day we were doing community meeting, and we ask for announcements.

1067
01:30:04,720 --> 01:30:05,846
And this guy raises his hand.

1068
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:12,327
And he looks directly at Liza Green and he says, I know you don't know me.

1069
01:30:12,440 --> 01:30:13,009
I just got here.

1070
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:14,770
But I just want to say that I've been watching you.

1071
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:16,803
I think you're the most interesting thing about this>>

1072
01:30:16,920 --> 01:30:21,563
place, and I'm really sad I'm not going to get to know you before you leave.

1073
01:30:21,680 --> 01:30:23,125
I just wanted to tell you that.

1074
01:30:23,240 --> 01:30:24,969
What a pimp!

1075
01:30:25,080 --> 01:30:27,168
What did she say? Nothing.

1076
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:29,207
Nothing? It was so awkward.

1077
01:30:29,360 --> 01:30:30,885
Yeah, so fuckin' awkward I couldn't stand it.

1078
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,162
And then she left, and never talked to him.

1079
01:30:33,320 --> 01:30:35,561
The kids teased him for like a year.

1080
01:30:35,680 --> 01:30:37,449
Aw. Oh, that blows.

1081
01:30:37,560 --> 01:30:40,008
No, he didn't give a shit. No, didn't even faze him.

1082
01:30:40,160 --> 01:30:43,881
It was like he knew something everybody else didn't.

1083
01:30:44,040 --> 01:30:46,287
Who is this guy? That was Marcus.

1084
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:48,167
What? I never heard this story.

1085
01:30:48,280 --> 01:30:49,762
Oh, wait. It gets so much better.

1086
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:51,602
Yeah. Yeah, so check this out.

1087
01:30:51,720 --> 01:30:54,289
Grace and I are getting coffee at Ronnie's this morning, and we walk in.

1088
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:56,846
And who do we see sitting there alone at a table?

1089
01:30:56,960 --> 01:30:58,291
Marcus.

1090
01:30:58,400 --> 01:30:59,878
How's he doing? Oh!

1091
01:30:59,879 --> 01:31:01,923
He looks great. He's so good.

1092
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:02,802
Buttoned-up shirt.

1093
01:31:02,920 --> 01:31:04,763
He's sippin' on a cappuccino.

1094
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:07,289
Marcus drinks cappuccino? Yeah.

1095
01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:09,288
Apparently. Yeah, I guess so.

1096
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:10,851
Apparently now he does.

1097
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:13,243
So we're talking to him and we're catching up.

1098
01:31:13,400 --> 01:31:14,943
And he's telling us about his new job at the>>

1099
01:31:14,969 --> 01:31:16,511
aquarium and how much he takes home in tips.

1100
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:18,922
And now he's going to start applying for classes next semester.

1101
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:20,849
Oh my god! Yeah.

1102
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:23,247
And it's weird because I'm like, I have not heard Marcus>>

1103
01:31:23,360 --> 01:31:25,601
talk this much ever, since I met him.

1104
01:31:25,720 --> 01:31:28,642
Like, what is the deal? Is he excited to see us?

1105
01:31:28,760 --> 01:31:29,807
Is he nervous about something?

1106
01:31:29,960 --> 01:31:33,521
And that's when I notice there's another cappuccino on>>

1107
01:31:33,640 --> 01:31:36,041
the table and an empty chair next to him.

1108
01:31:36,160 --> 01:31:40,768
And then just like in the fucking movies, bathroom door>>

1109
01:31:40,880 --> 01:31:45,204
flings open, out walks Liza Green.

1110
01:31:45,320 --> 01:31:47,520
They were on a date? It was like their fifth one.

1111
01:31:47,640 --> 01:31:49,603
Yes! Oh!

1112
01:31:49,680 --> 01:31:53,048
As soon-- as soon as she sits down, dude just goes beet-red.

1113
01:31:53,160 --> 01:31:54,967
He's so embarrassed. Oh, it was so cute.

1114
01:31:55,080 --> 01:31:57,526
Oh, it was so fucking cute, I almost pissed my pants.

1115
01:31:57,640 --> 01:32:01,081
- Oh Jess, they look so happy together. - So happy.

1116
01:32:01,240 --> 01:32:02,207
And there's just-->>

1117
01:32:04,320 --> 01:32:09,403
Here we go.

1118
 01:32:10,570--> 01:34:00,570
