1
00:01:00,415 --> 00:01:03,665
Just packed up a real money load, and it's coming your way.

2
00:01:03,752 --> 00:01:07,915
Look for "Rodgers" on the truck's side. Don't forget my share of the deal.

3
00:03:57,727 --> 00:03:58,708
Shit!

4
00:04:39,845 --> 00:04:43,296
- Tuna on white, no crust, right? - I don't know. How is it?

5
00:04:43,974 --> 00:04:48,268
Every day, for the last three weeks, you've come here, asking how the tuna is.

6
00:04:48,353 --> 00:04:52,102
Now, it was crappy yesterday. It was crappy the day before.

7
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:54,978
And guess what? It hasn't changed.

8
00:04:55,611 --> 00:04:57,520
- I'll have the tuna. - No crust?

9
00:04:57,613 --> 00:04:58,692
No crust.

10
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:24,044
Thank you.

11
00:06:11,103 --> 00:06:13,476
Talk to me, Jesse. This ain't working, brother.

12
00:06:13,564 --> 00:06:16,186
It's your fuel map. It's got a nasty hole.

13
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:19,361
- That's why you're unloading in third. - Told you.

14
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:24,570
I lengthen the injector pulse a millisecond. Just tune the NOS timer, you'll run nines.

15
00:06:32,417 --> 00:06:35,038
What's up with this fool? Is he sandwich-crazy?

16
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:39,754
- No. He ain't here for the food, dog. - Chill out. He's slinging parts for Harry.

17
00:06:39,841 --> 00:06:43,340
- I know what he's slinging. - He's trying to get in Mia's pants, dog.

18
00:06:43,428 --> 00:06:45,670
- What's up, guys? - How you doing, Mia?

19
00:06:45,763 --> 00:06:47,922
- How you living, girl? - Hey!

20
00:06:48,516 --> 00:06:50,924
Hey, Dom. You want something to drink?

21
00:07:01,946 --> 00:07:05,066
- He's beautiful. - I like his haircut.

22
00:07:07,786 --> 00:07:08,817
Vince!

23
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,072
- What? - Can I get you anything?

24
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,114
You look good.

25
00:07:19,297 --> 00:07:21,967
- Thanks a lot, Mia. See you tomorrow. - Sure.

26
00:07:24,886 --> 00:07:26,843
- Tomorrow? - I love this part.

27
00:07:31,601 --> 00:07:36,228
Try Fatburger from now on. Get yourself a Double Cheese with fries for $2.95, faggot.

28
00:07:36,314 --> 00:07:39,814
- I like the tuna here. - Bullshit. No one likes the tuna here.

29
00:07:39,901 --> 00:07:41,312
Yeah, well, I do.

30
00:07:53,832 --> 00:07:57,367
Jesus Christ, Dom! Would you get out there? I'm sick of this shit.

31
00:07:57,461 --> 00:07:59,786
I'm not kidding, Dom. Get out there!

32
00:08:04,176 --> 00:08:06,667
- What did you put in that sandwich? - That's funny.

33
00:08:06,762 --> 00:08:08,968
- Dom! - All right.

34
00:08:27,491 --> 00:08:30,362
- Hey, man. He was in my face. - I'm in your face.

35
00:08:31,996 --> 00:08:34,913
Relax! Don't push it! You embarrass me!

36
00:08:37,585 --> 00:08:38,865
Get over there!

37
00:08:40,379 --> 00:08:42,170
Jesse, give me the wallet.

38
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:48,419
"Brian Earl Spilner. " Sounds like a serial killer name.

39
00:08:48,554 --> 00:08:50,345
- Is that what you are? - No, man.

40
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:52,388
Don't come around here again.

41
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:56,719
Hey, man. This is bullshit.

42
00:08:57,772 --> 00:09:00,772
- You work for Harry, right? - Yeah. I just started.

43
00:09:00,983 --> 00:09:02,525
You were just fired.

44
00:09:15,456 --> 00:09:18,576
Hey, Dominic. I appreciate what you did, in a big way.

45
00:09:19,085 --> 00:09:20,579
Dominic, I owe you.

46
00:09:22,505 --> 00:09:27,048
Brian, you're messing with my business. When Dominic drives, he's golden.

47
00:09:27,176 --> 00:09:31,803
Kids pour in. They want everything he has. Every performance part. They pay cash!

48
00:09:32,348 --> 00:09:35,100
- What did Dominic say? - You don't want to know.

49
00:09:35,435 --> 00:09:38,305
- What did Dominic say? - He wants you out of here.

50
00:09:38,896 --> 00:09:40,854
- He wants me out of here? - Yes.

51
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:44,226
- And what did you say to Dom? - What do you think I said?

52
00:09:44,527 --> 00:09:47,018
I told him, "Good help is hard to find. ">>

53
00:09:50,199 --> 00:09:51,231
Relax.

54
00:09:54,913 --> 00:09:56,158
I need NOS.

55
00:09:56,706 --> 00:09:58,912
- I need NOS. - No.

56
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:01,871
My car topped out at 140 miles per hour, this morning.

57
00:10:01,961 --> 00:10:06,374
Amateurs don't use nitrous oxide. I've seen how you drive. You've a heavy foot.

58
00:10:07,175 --> 00:10:10,295
- You'll blow yourself to pieces. - I need one of these.

59
00:10:10,553 --> 00:10:13,922
One of the big ones. Actually, let's make it two.

60
00:10:14,432 --> 00:10:16,591
And, Harry, I need it by tonight.

61
00:11:28,382 --> 00:11:31,667
Hold up, hold up. Look at this snowman right here, man.

62
00:11:36,014 --> 00:11:38,850
Sweet ride. What you running under there, man?

63
00:11:41,603 --> 00:11:44,474
- Going to make me find out the hard way? - Hell, yeah.

64
00:11:44,565 --> 00:11:47,435
You brave. You brave. They call me Hector.

65
00:11:48,068 --> 00:11:50,856
I got a last name, too, but I can't pronounce it.

66
00:11:50,946 --> 00:11:53,402
- Brian Spilner. - Typical white-boy name.

67
00:11:53,741 --> 00:11:55,614
Know what I'm saying?

68
00:11:57,912 --> 00:12:02,787
See that over there? That's mine. My baby. I ain't cutting her loose tonight.

69
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:04,910
- Why not? - I'm going legit, homey.

70
00:12:05,002 --> 00:12:07,671
Trying to get on the NIRA circuit. Heard about that?

71
00:12:07,755 --> 00:12:10,756
- Hell, yeah. - So, what's up with you, man?

72
00:12:10,966 --> 00:12:15,130
- I'm just waiting for Toretto. - Shit. Better get in line. This yours?

73
00:12:16,305 --> 00:12:18,796
- I'm standing next to it. - That's funny.

74
00:12:18,933 --> 00:12:21,602
You know, Edwin happens to know a few things.

75
00:12:23,771 --> 00:12:25,977
And one of the things Edwin knows is: It's not how you stand by your car...>>

76
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,316
...it's how you race your car. You better learn that.

77
00:12:35,283 --> 00:12:38,200
Oh, shit. Here they come. It's on.

78
00:12:53,593 --> 00:12:55,384
- Dom. - Marvin.

79
00:12:57,096 --> 00:13:00,679
- Hey, Dom. How you doing? - Hey, Camille. You been doing yoga?

80
00:13:05,063 --> 00:13:07,980
You did? Of course you did. Monica.

81
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,853
I smell skanks.

82
00:13:13,571 --> 00:13:17,439
Why don't you girls pack it up, before I leave tread marks on your face?

83
00:13:17,534 --> 00:13:18,447
Okay.

84
00:13:18,701 --> 00:13:21,371
- Letty, I was just talking. - Yeah. Whatever.

85
00:13:21,788 --> 00:13:24,789
- Okay, Hector. - Yeah? What's up, man?

86
00:13:26,501 --> 00:13:28,043
- Yo. What's up? - Edwin.

87
00:13:28,128 --> 00:13:30,500
- How we doing this tonight? - One race.

88
00:13:31,005 --> 00:13:35,134
$2,000 buy-in. Winner takes all. Hector, you're going to hold the cash.

89
00:13:35,635 --> 00:13:38,636
- Why Hector? - Too slow to make away with the money.

90
00:13:41,099 --> 00:13:43,768
- Okay. Good luck, guys. - Hey, wait. Hold up.

91
00:13:44,269 --> 00:13:48,136
I don't have any cash. But I do have the pink slip to my car.

92
00:13:48,607 --> 00:13:52,439
You just can't climb in the ring with Ali, 'cause you think you box.

93
00:13:52,652 --> 00:13:55,902
He knows I can box. Check it out. It's like this.

94
00:13:56,907 --> 00:14:00,026
I lose, the winner takes my car. Clean and clear.

95
00:14:00,452 --> 00:14:03,821
But if I win, I take the cash, and I take the respect.

96
00:14:04,456 --> 00:14:05,487
Respect.

97
00:14:07,834 --> 00:14:10,206
To some people, that's more important.

98
00:14:12,339 --> 00:14:13,667
That your car?

99
00:14:17,469 --> 00:14:22,297
I see a cool air intake. It's got a NOS fogger system and a T 4 turbo, Dominic.

100
00:14:22,474 --> 00:14:27,432
I see an AIC controller. It has direct port nitrous injection.

101
00:14:27,688 --> 00:14:30,475
Yeah. And a stand-alone fuel management system.

102
00:14:31,483 --> 00:14:33,559
Not a bad way to spend $10,000.

103
00:14:36,572 --> 00:14:38,030
You see that shit?

104
00:14:38,907 --> 00:14:42,193
He's got enough NOS in there to blow himself up. Period.

105
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,287
- So, what do you say? Am I worthy? - We don't know yet.

106
00:14:46,999 --> 00:14:48,790
But you're in. Let's go.

107
00:14:49,668 --> 00:14:51,210
- All right. - Let's go!

108
00:15:55,651 --> 00:15:59,483
- What the hell is going on around here? - Street's closed, pizza boy.

109
00:15:59,989 --> 00:16:02,907
- Find another way home. - Goddamn street racers.

110
00:16:03,659 --> 00:16:07,953
Log on, 22. Code 3. Tension is high. They've blocked the street.

111
00:16:54,127 --> 00:16:55,502
Edwin.

112
00:16:57,047 --> 00:17:00,001
This is yours, whether you win or lose.

113
00:17:00,884 --> 00:17:03,505
But if you win, you get her, too.

114
00:17:13,021 --> 00:17:14,563
You're going to win.

115
00:17:15,941 --> 00:17:17,518
I'm going to win.

116
00:18:01,904 --> 00:18:04,774
We had a reported homicide. 187, at Barabian Liquors.

117
00:18:04,865 --> 00:18:09,242
I've got a 187 in Glendale. Cops are all over it. We're good to roll.

118
00:18:09,954 --> 00:18:11,364
- All right. - Let's race!

119
00:18:11,455 --> 00:18:12,486
Right.

120
00:18:22,258 --> 00:18:23,040
Go!

121
00:18:37,189 --> 00:18:38,304
Hell, yeah!

122
00:18:54,373 --> 00:18:55,998
Damn, that guy's fast.

123
00:19:04,175 --> 00:19:06,333
Let's go! Ménage!

124
00:19:33,371 --> 00:19:36,158
No! Monica!

125
00:19:51,931 --> 00:19:53,390
Shut up!

126
00:20:48,113 --> 00:20:49,607
Well done, baby!

127
00:20:58,999 --> 00:21:00,908
Come on. Come on. Back up.

128
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:05,044
Here's what you won, right here. There you go.

129
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:08,001
You were racing a bunch of skateboards. Know what I mean?

130
00:21:09,426 --> 00:21:12,096
My sister holds the money. Count it.

131
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,718
And you're my trophy.

132
00:21:19,979 --> 00:21:23,928
- Hey, Monica. What's up, baby? - What's your problem? You didn't win.

133
00:21:26,902 --> 00:21:28,183
Fuck you then!

134
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,781
Was that fun?

135
00:21:43,002 --> 00:21:44,911
Got a problem there, buddy?

136
00:21:51,635 --> 00:21:54,886
- What are you smiling about? - Dude. I almost had you.

137
00:21:57,725 --> 00:21:59,516
You almost had me?

138
00:22:00,186 --> 00:22:02,641
You never had me. You never had your car.

139
00:22:05,942 --> 00:22:09,108
Granny-shifting. Not double-clutching, like you should.

140
00:22:10,029 --> 00:22:14,193
You're lucky that 100-shot of NOS didn't blow the welds on the intake.

141
00:22:15,451 --> 00:22:19,829
- Almost had me? - You tell him, Dominic. Get out of here.

142
00:22:21,207 --> 00:22:24,291
Now, me and the mad scientist got to rip apart the block...>>

143
00:22:24,377 --> 00:22:26,950
...and replace the piston rings you fried.

144
00:22:34,721 --> 00:22:36,760
Ask any racer. Any real racer.

145
00:22:37,515 --> 00:22:41,976
It don't matter if you win by an inch or a mile. Winning's winning.

146
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:43,598
Yeah!

147
00:22:49,194 --> 00:22:52,278
All available units, we have street-racing along Hawthorne...>>

148
00:22:52,363 --> 00:22:54,273
Oh, shit! We got cops. Cops!

149
00:22:54,574 --> 00:22:55,819
Go!

150
00:23:07,545 --> 00:23:09,337
Cops! Get in the car! Go!

151
00:24:33,591 --> 00:24:35,797
Toretto, stop right there!

152
00:24:37,511 --> 00:24:38,626
Toretto!

153
00:24:53,652 --> 00:24:54,851
Get in!

154
00:25:41,367 --> 00:25:44,701
You're the last person in the world I expected to show up.

155
00:25:45,872 --> 00:25:49,786
I thought if I got in your good graces, you might let me keep my car.

156
00:25:50,043 --> 00:25:53,376
You are in my good graces, but you ain't keeping your car.

157
00:25:54,255 --> 00:25:57,256
You drive like you've done this before. Are you a wheelman?

158
00:25:57,342 --> 00:25:59,714
- No. - You boost cars?

159
00:26:02,138 --> 00:26:04,297
- No. Never. - Ever done time?

160
00:26:04,682 --> 00:26:07,008
Couple of overnighters. No big deal.

161
00:26:07,769 --> 00:26:10,805
What about the two years in juvie for boosting cars?

162
00:26:13,775 --> 00:26:15,269
Tucson, right?

163
00:26:15,985 --> 00:26:19,070
I had Jesse run a profile on you, Brian Earl Spilner.

164
00:26:20,615 --> 00:26:23,782
He'll find anything on the Web. Anything about anybody.

165
00:26:24,494 --> 00:26:25,905
So, why bullshit?

166
00:26:27,622 --> 00:26:29,116
So, what about you?

167
00:26:31,585 --> 00:26:33,079
Two years in Lompoc.

168
00:26:36,131 --> 00:26:37,922
I'll die before I go back.

169
00:26:44,055 --> 00:26:46,048
- Oh, great. - What?

170
00:26:48,977 --> 00:26:51,349
It's going to be a long-ass night. That's what.

171
00:26:55,651 --> 00:26:57,026
Follow us.

172
00:27:47,745 --> 00:27:51,956
I thought we had an agreement. You stay away. I stay away.

173
00:27:53,375 --> 00:27:55,000
Everybody stays happy.

174
00:27:55,127 --> 00:27:57,452
We got lost. What do you want me to tell you?

175
00:27:57,546 --> 00:28:00,464
- Who's "we"? - My new mechanic.

176
00:28:00,841 --> 00:28:02,668
Brian, meet Johnny Tran.

177
00:28:02,802 --> 00:28:05,803
The guy in the snakeskin pants. That's his cousin. Lance.

178
00:28:05,888 --> 00:28:09,589
So, when are you going to give me a shot at that Honda 2000 of yours?

179
00:28:09,684 --> 00:28:12,091
- This your ride? - It was. It's his now.

180
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:15,011
No, it's not. I haven't taken delivery.

181
00:28:17,191 --> 00:28:20,892
Then, it's nobody's car. But somebody put in the wrench time.

182
00:28:23,948 --> 00:28:27,566
- What do you think, Lance? - It's an amazing machine.

183
00:28:28,244 --> 00:28:29,703
Yes, indeed.

184
00:28:31,914 --> 00:28:33,325
Let's go.

185
00:28:35,501 --> 00:28:39,914
I'll see you in the desert next month. Be ready to have your ass handed to you.

186
00:28:40,173 --> 00:28:44,040
- You'll need more than that crotch rocket. - I got something for you.

187
00:28:57,941 --> 00:29:01,475
- What the hell was that all about? - Long story. I'll tell you later.

188
00:29:01,569 --> 00:29:03,194
Let's get out of here.

189
00:29:30,598 --> 00:29:31,713
NOS!

190
00:29:43,904 --> 00:29:47,320
- So, what the hell was that all about? - It's a long story.

191
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,109
Well, we got a 20-mile hike. Humor me.

192
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:53,242
A business deal that went sour.

193
00:29:54,206 --> 00:29:57,290
Plus, I made the mistake of sleeping with his sister.

194
00:30:23,485 --> 00:30:24,730
Take care.

195
00:30:29,825 --> 00:30:31,367
Yo, Spilner.

196
00:30:32,786 --> 00:30:34,993
- You want a beer? - Yeah, sure.

197
00:30:35,664 --> 00:30:37,242
Oh, shit.

198
00:31:01,315 --> 00:31:04,269
We were all there, right? Falling behind.

199
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,815
- With all that nitrous. - Yeah.

200
00:31:13,702 --> 00:31:17,154
Yo, Dom. We were just about to go looking for you, brother.

201
00:31:23,087 --> 00:31:24,367
Where were you?

202
00:31:24,463 --> 00:31:28,710
There were mass cops there. They came in from every direction. It was orchestrated.

203
00:31:28,801 --> 00:31:31,173
- This your beer? - Yeah, that's my beer.

204
00:31:34,265 --> 00:31:36,756
Yo, Einstein. Take it upstairs.

205
00:31:37,435 --> 00:31:39,973
You can't detail a car with the cover on.

206
00:31:40,813 --> 00:31:43,684
- Can't even get that right. - You all right?

207
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:48,731
- Am I all right? - It was just a question.

208
00:31:52,492 --> 00:31:53,772
Yo, Dom.

209
00:31:54,035 --> 00:31:58,115
- Why did you bring the buster here? - 'Cause he kept me out of handcuffs!

210
00:31:58,373 --> 00:32:02,205
He didn't just run back to the fort! The buster brought me back.

211
00:32:08,091 --> 00:32:11,839
You can have any brew you want, as long as it's a Corona.

212
00:32:12,512 --> 00:32:15,133
- Thanks, man. - That's Vince's. So, enjoy it.

213
00:32:17,141 --> 00:32:18,386
You.

214
00:32:25,525 --> 00:32:29,605
- Hey, bro. You got a bathroom? - Upstairs. First door on the right.

215
00:32:45,837 --> 00:32:49,253
He's got no call being up in here. You don't know that fool for shit.

216
00:32:49,341 --> 00:32:52,840
- He's right, Dom. - There was a time when I didn't know you.

217
00:32:53,011 --> 00:32:54,920
That was in the third grade!

218
00:32:58,141 --> 00:33:01,641
- Yeah. So, what girls are here? - You name it. You want mine?

219
00:33:01,728 --> 00:33:04,136
- You need to shut the... - You want two?

220
00:33:04,356 --> 00:33:07,025
- You don't have anything? - You look a bit tired.

221
00:33:07,109 --> 00:33:09,896
I think you should go upstairs and give me a massage.

222
00:33:09,986 --> 00:33:13,355
- Look at all our guests. - How about you give me a massage?

223
00:33:16,702 --> 00:33:18,160
Crazy lady.

224
00:33:25,836 --> 00:33:28,505
You know you owe me a 10-second car, right?

225
00:33:33,135 --> 00:33:34,415
Oh, shit.

226
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:41,808
Did you wipe the seat?

227
00:33:45,063 --> 00:33:48,433
Jesus Christ! Would you cut this shit? Come on!

228
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:55,758
- Come on. Let's go get me a drink. - We were just about to get along.

229
00:34:02,623 --> 00:34:05,790
- So, what do you want? - Anything, as long as it's cold.

230
00:34:07,419 --> 00:34:11,002
You know, my brother likes you. He usually doesn't like anybody.

231
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:14,340
- He's a complicated guy. - Yeah? What about you?

232
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:19,880
- I'm simpler. - You're a shitty liar.

233
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,926
Well, I'll take that as a compliment.

234
00:34:25,604 --> 00:34:28,274
- But there's a problem. - What's that?

235
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:30,564
You need to get some sleep.

236
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:35,101
And you definitely, definitely need a shower.

237
00:34:36,073 --> 00:34:38,362
Come on. I'll take you home.

238
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:03,098
Show me your hands. Very good. Now open the door.

239
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:06,721
Put your hands on your head. Behind your head.

240
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:10,854
Face the front of the vehicle, walk backwards towards the rear.

241
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:14,436
Take two steps to your right. Stop right there.

242
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:21,440
- What did I do? - Shut up. He's clean, Sarge.

243
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:34,539
Damn! Muse, will you take these things off?

244
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:37,550
- Shit. You put them on so tight. - I like realism.

245
00:35:38,178 --> 00:35:40,503
You never know who's watching, Brian.

246
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:48,593
Nice crib, Sergeant. It's a lot nicer than the last place you confiscated.

247
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:52,900
Ain't it? Eddie Fisher built this house for Elizabeth Taylor in the '50s.

248
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:55,985
You see, even the cops are Hollywood in Hollywood.

249
00:35:59,741 --> 00:36:03,075
Okay, here he is, fresh from Toretto's hot rod heaven.

250
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,486
That was an $80,000 vehicle, Officer.

251
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,787
- You told him what happened? - He knows.

252
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:11,789
- Send the bill to Johnny Tran. - The kid's giving me attitude?

253
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:14,630
It doesn't speak well for police/FBI relations, Tanner.

254
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:18,333
- I walk in the door and the guy's already- - All right, all right.

255
00:36:18,427 --> 00:36:20,633
We'll talk, okay? Let's talk about it.

256
00:36:20,721 --> 00:36:24,006
Muse, why don't you make us four iced cappuccinos, please?

257
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:26,424
- Come on. - Regular or decaf, Sarge?

258
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,430
Decaf, I think.

259
00:36:29,771 --> 00:36:32,476
Four hijackings in two months, and we have nothing.

260
00:36:32,566 --> 00:36:35,650
The DVD players and digital cameras are worth $1.2 million...>>

261
00:36:35,736 --> 00:36:38,523
...which brings the grand total to $6 million plus.

262
00:36:38,614 --> 00:36:41,449
We're in the political crosshairs now, Brian.

263
00:36:42,201 --> 00:36:44,027
That's why you're undercover.

264
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:48,069
You want that detective badge fast, kid. And you want to know something?

265
00:36:48,415 --> 00:36:51,250
The FBI can help, if you come through for us.

266
00:36:52,294 --> 00:36:54,251
What does the truckdriver say?

267
00:36:54,338 --> 00:36:57,873
He gave us the same M.O.: Three Honda Civics, precision driving...>>

268
00:36:57,966 --> 00:37:00,920
...the same green neon glow from under the chassis.

269
00:37:01,011 --> 00:37:05,472
Lab says the skidmarks came back the same: Mashamoto ZX tires.

270
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:08,262
So, we know it's somebody in the street-racing world.

271
00:37:08,352 --> 00:37:12,813
If we don't make this case, the truckers will take matters into their own hands.

272
00:37:12,898 --> 00:37:14,606
I tell them we're close.

273
00:37:15,818 --> 00:37:17,727
Are you going to make me a liar?

274
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:19,362
Look, what do we know?

275
00:37:19,446 --> 00:37:21,937
We know this world revolves around Toretto, right?

276
00:37:22,032 --> 00:37:25,117
I'm not saying that he's the one that's popping these trucks...>>

277
00:37:25,202 --> 00:37:29,532
...but I can guarantee he knows who is. It's just a matter of time until I win->>

278
00:37:29,623 --> 00:37:33,573
You want time, buy the magazine. We don't have time.

279
00:37:35,379 --> 00:37:37,455
Just get me something I can use.

280
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,960
Is Harry cooperating?

281
00:37:41,052 --> 00:37:44,634
Like a guy that'll do time for receiving stolen property if he doesn't.

282
00:37:44,722 --> 00:37:46,845
What kind of vibe is he getting from Toretto?

283
00:37:46,932 --> 00:37:50,052
He's scared of him, but he doesn't think he's jacking trucks.

284
00:37:50,144 --> 00:37:52,516
- He's too controlled for that. - Wait.

285
00:37:52,605 --> 00:37:55,725
Not that I want to contradict Harry's fine judge of character...>>

286
00:37:55,816 --> 00:37:59,351
...but Toretto did hard time for nearly beating a guy to death.

287
00:37:59,445 --> 00:38:02,565
He's got nitrous oxide in his blood and a gas tank for a brain.

288
00:38:02,657 --> 00:38:04,566
Do not turn your back on him.

289
00:38:04,992 --> 00:38:06,535
Tanner, I'm gonna need another car.

290
00:38:12,083 --> 00:38:14,490
- What about parts and service? - Hold off on it.

291
00:38:14,585 --> 00:38:16,911
Dom, I don't know what to do with it.

292
00:38:20,008 --> 00:38:23,840
All right, what the hell is this? What do you got there?

293
00:38:25,596 --> 00:38:28,004
- This is your car. - My car?

294
00:38:28,641 --> 00:38:31,595
I said a 10-second car, not a 10-minute car.

295
00:38:31,686 --> 00:38:35,518
You could push this across the finish line, or tow it.

296
00:38:36,816 --> 00:38:39,734
You couldn't even tow that across the finish line.

297
00:38:40,487 --> 00:38:41,685
No faith.

298
00:38:41,779 --> 00:38:44,187
I have faith in you, but this isn't a junkyard.

299
00:38:44,282 --> 00:38:46,524
- This is a garage. - Pop the hood.

300
00:38:46,826 --> 00:38:48,071
- Pop the hood? - Pop the hood.

301
00:38:51,206 --> 00:38:54,871
- 2JZ engine. No shit. - And what did I tell you?

302
00:38:54,959 --> 00:38:57,711
- I retract my previous statement. - You know what?

303
00:38:57,796 --> 00:39:02,374
This will decimate all after you put about $15,000 in it.

304
00:39:02,467 --> 00:39:06,216
Or more, if we have to overnight parts from Japan.

305
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:09,384
- We'll put it on my tab at Harry's. - Yes!

306
00:39:09,808 --> 00:39:13,592
I gotta get you racing again so I can make some money off your ass.

307
00:39:14,145 --> 00:39:16,850
There's a show down in the desert called Race Wars.

308
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:19,229
That's where you'll do it.

309
00:39:19,609 --> 00:39:22,943
When you're not working at Harry's, you're working here.

310
00:39:23,196 --> 00:39:26,945
If you can't find the right tool in this garage, Mr. Arizona...>>

311
00:39:27,185 --> 00:39:29,430
...you don't belong near a car.

312
00:39:33,123 --> 00:39:34,498
He owns you now.

313
00:40:01,819 --> 00:40:03,610
Tell me what you think about this. Koni adjustables.

314
00:40:04,446 --> 00:40:06,653
Gonna save us about 2 pounds.

315
00:40:06,865 --> 00:40:10,199
And they're gonna give us better traction for the hole shot.

316
00:40:10,285 --> 00:40:11,530
All right?

317
00:40:12,371 --> 00:40:14,447
This is your basic layout of the car.

318
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:18,372
And that's pretty much what it could look like when it's finished.

319
00:40:19,128 --> 00:40:20,503
Red, green.

320
00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:24,665
- You should be going to MIT or something. - Yeah, right.

321
00:40:25,342 --> 00:40:28,177
No, I got that... What's it called?

322
00:40:29,263 --> 00:40:31,421
That attention disorder->>

323
00:40:31,515 --> 00:40:35,216
- ADD? - Yes, that shit. Yeah.

324
00:40:36,353 --> 00:40:40,268
You know, I was good in algebra and like math and shit.

325
00:40:41,108 --> 00:40:44,857
Everything else I failed. Dropped out of school.

326
00:40:45,738 --> 00:40:48,858
I don't know. It's just something about engines...>>

327
00:40:48,949 --> 00:40:52,069
...that calms me down, you know.

328
00:41:12,932 --> 00:41:15,388
- I'm outta here. - Come on, dog.

329
00:41:16,018 --> 00:41:18,688
- Yo, Dom. - Vince, get over here and give us a hand.

330
00:41:18,771 --> 00:41:21,689
Looks like you got all the help you need, brother.

331
00:41:35,371 --> 00:41:38,491
- Mia! The chicken's dry. - All right. I'm coming out already.

332
00:41:43,838 --> 00:41:45,332
Here you go.

333
00:41:47,258 --> 00:41:48,669
Hey, hold up.

334
00:41:49,177 --> 00:41:54,420
Because you were the first to reach in to get the chicken, you say grace.

335
00:42:00,438 --> 00:42:03,143
- Dear heavenly... - Spirit.

336
00:42:04,818 --> 00:42:06,478
Spirit. Thank you.

337
00:42:07,028 --> 00:42:12,236
Thank you for providing us with a direct port nitrous injection...>>

338
00:42:13,201 --> 00:42:17,033
...four core intercoolers and ball-bearing turbos...>>

339
00:42:17,205 --> 00:42:19,696
...and titanium valve springs.

340
00:42:20,458 --> 00:42:22,083
- Thank you. - Amen.

341
00:42:23,211 --> 00:42:25,168
- Not bad. - Amen.

342
00:42:25,255 --> 00:42:27,497
He was praying to the car gods, man.

343
00:42:28,842 --> 00:42:30,384
He's not the best.

344
00:42:30,468 --> 00:42:32,627
- What do you want? - Practice.

345
00:42:32,721 --> 00:42:34,049
Thank you, girl.

346
00:42:34,139 --> 00:42:37,722
Look who it is. "Old Coyotes 'R' Us. ">>

347
00:42:37,809 --> 00:42:40,561
I thought you weren't hungry, pumpkin.

348
00:42:40,729 --> 00:42:43,683
- You know, I gotta eat. - He's always hungry.

349
00:42:43,774 --> 00:42:45,813
All right, sit down.

350
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,109
How you doing, Mia?

351
00:42:58,288 --> 00:42:59,913
Here you go.

352
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:09,131
- Jesse, hand me that chicken. - Let's eat some grub, man.

353
00:43:09,216 --> 00:43:12,336
- Want some of that chicken? - What, you rent a movie or something?

354
00:43:19,435 --> 00:43:21,344
Need a hand with anything else?

355
00:43:21,437 --> 00:43:24,888
No, I'm good. You can go join the boys and watch the movie.

356
00:43:25,399 --> 00:43:29,064
- The cook doesn't clean where I come from. - I'd like to go there.

357
00:43:34,241 --> 00:43:38,453
- I think we should go out sometime. - No, I don't date my brother's friends.

358
00:43:39,163 --> 00:43:40,657
That sucks.

359
00:43:40,748 --> 00:43:44,081
- I'll have to kick his ass then. - I'd love to see that one.

360
00:43:44,168 --> 00:43:47,453
I would pay to see that one, actually.

361
00:44:01,394 --> 00:44:03,102
Wash my car when you get done.

362
00:44:03,187 --> 00:44:06,852
- What was that? - No, Mia. I'm talking to the punk.

363
00:44:07,692 --> 00:44:10,147
Wear your favorite dress, 'cause when you're done...>>

364
00:44:10,236 --> 00:44:13,521
...I'm putting you on the street where you belong, cutie.

365
00:44:16,826 --> 00:44:20,526
Is this thing broken? What's wrong with this thing?

366
00:44:21,789 --> 00:44:25,787
What was that Cuban restaurant you wanted to take me to?

367
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:27,953
The one with the picadillo and->>

368
00:44:28,045 --> 00:44:31,829
- With red candles, wooden tables- - The plantain, food all over the place.

369
00:44:31,924 --> 00:44:33,798
- What it's called? - Cha Cha Cha.

370
00:44:33,885 --> 00:44:35,842
- Yeah, that's it. - Yeah.

371
00:44:37,013 --> 00:44:39,005
Well, you can take me there.

372
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:41,761
Friday night at 10:00. Is that good for you?

373
00:44:42,393 --> 00:44:44,433
- Yeah, it's perfect. - Good.

374
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:54,774
- There's no popcorn. - Make your own goddamn popcorn!

375
00:45:08,795 --> 00:45:11,368
All right. Now that's valet parking.

376
00:45:15,301 --> 00:45:17,590
- Harry. What's up, dog? - Nice to see you.

377
00:45:17,679 --> 00:45:19,506
Excellent. Come on in, man.

378
00:45:19,597 --> 00:45:22,717
- Check it. It's yours. - Damn. What do we got here?

379
00:45:23,852 --> 00:45:26,343
- Hired some new help? - Don't even think about it.

380
00:45:26,438 --> 00:45:28,893
- What's up? - What's up, Brian? How you feeling?

381
00:45:28,982 --> 00:45:31,899
- Pretty good. What do you need? - What's up, man?

382
00:45:31,985 --> 00:45:35,520
I need you to hook me up. Three of everything. I made a list.

383
00:45:37,157 --> 00:45:39,114
Why don't you look that over?

384
00:45:39,409 --> 00:45:42,576
- When do you need this stuff by? - Tomorrow, today, now.

385
00:45:42,996 --> 00:45:45,238
- Right. - White boys work fast, don't they?

386
00:45:48,502 --> 00:45:49,830
That's right.

387
00:45:52,714 --> 00:45:56,214
- You said you need three of each? - Yeah, three of everything.

388
00:45:57,010 --> 00:45:59,680
What do you think about that? Check this out.

389
00:48:07,809 --> 00:48:09,351
He moans like a cop.

390
00:48:18,653 --> 00:48:22,817
Brian, this is one of those times you need to be clear about what you say.

391
00:48:23,575 --> 00:48:25,567
Nod if you understand me.

392
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:26,941
Nod!

393
00:48:28,788 --> 00:48:30,199
Sit up.

394
00:48:36,463 --> 00:48:39,132
Tell me what the hell you're doing down here.

395
00:48:39,424 --> 00:48:41,880
Shit. What I'm doing?

396
00:48:44,471 --> 00:48:45,846
Dom.

397
00:48:48,099 --> 00:48:50,804
I owe you a 10-second car.

398
00:48:51,770 --> 00:48:55,388
And what this is about, this is about Race Wars.

399
00:48:58,568 --> 00:49:02,436
I just went in there, and Hector is gonna be running...>>

400
00:49:02,906 --> 00:49:05,444
...three Honda Civics with Spoon engines.

401
00:49:05,575 --> 00:49:08,411
And on top of that, he just came into Harry's...>>

402
00:49:08,495 --> 00:49:12,742
...and he ordered three T66 turbos, with NOS...>>

403
00:49:14,376 --> 00:49:16,452
...and a MoTeC system exhaust.

404
00:49:19,965 --> 00:49:21,673
So, what are you saying?

405
00:49:22,885 --> 00:49:27,428
You're gonna check everybody's shit out, one garage after another?

406
00:49:30,309 --> 00:49:31,767
Yeah.

407
00:49:34,605 --> 00:49:38,519
Because, Dom, you know I can't lose again.

408
00:49:40,527 --> 00:49:41,903
He's a cop.

409
00:49:44,239 --> 00:49:45,354
He's a cop!

410
00:49:48,661 --> 00:49:49,989
You a cop?

411
00:49:56,502 --> 00:49:58,329
Let's go for a little ride.

412
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:02,715
Walk!

413
00:50:22,111 --> 00:50:23,819
Okay. You stand watch.

414
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:56,220
Yo, Dominic.

415
00:50:57,980 --> 00:50:59,640
There's no engines.

416
00:51:00,775 --> 00:51:03,527
What are they planning on racing with, hopes and dreams?

417
00:51:03,611 --> 00:51:06,019
I don't know, but they're sneaky as shit...>>

418
00:51:06,114 --> 00:51:08,949
...and they've got enough money to buy anything.

419
00:51:14,122 --> 00:51:15,071
What?

420
00:51:24,215 --> 00:51:25,544
We got a wolf pack.

421
00:51:26,050 --> 00:51:29,716
It's Johnny Tran, and he's coming your way really fast.

422
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:32,801
All right, we got company. Spilner.

423
00:51:58,792 --> 00:52:01,081
Come on. Move!

424
00:52:01,336 --> 00:52:03,376
Let me ask you a question, Ted.

425
00:52:04,881 --> 00:52:08,085
- Do you see anything wrong here? - No.

426
00:52:11,972 --> 00:52:14,379
- We got no engines, do we? - No.

427
00:52:14,474 --> 00:52:15,755
- Do we? - No.

428
00:52:18,854 --> 00:52:21,427
A couple of Nissan SR20 motors will pull a premium...>>

429
00:52:21,523 --> 00:52:24,559
- ... one week before Race Wars, huh? - Yeah, probably.

430
00:52:24,943 --> 00:52:27,944
You're a smart fence, Ted. Maybe too smart.

431
00:52:29,448 --> 00:52:31,357
What are you feeling, Lance?

432
00:52:32,868 --> 00:52:34,410
40-weight?

433
00:52:34,912 --> 00:52:36,738
50-weight?

434
00:52:37,372 --> 00:52:39,080
A 40-weight sounds nice.

435
00:52:54,682 --> 00:52:56,224
Where are they, Ted?

436
00:52:56,392 --> 00:52:58,218
- Where are they? - Enough!

437
00:52:58,394 --> 00:53:00,885
- Where are they? - They're in a warehouse.

438
00:53:01,438 --> 00:53:03,348
They're in a warehouse, man!

439
00:53:19,623 --> 00:53:20,904
Ted.

440
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,660
Kiss my shoes?

441
00:53:34,930 --> 00:53:36,804
Let's go get our engines.

442
00:53:37,683 --> 00:53:40,470
My superiors are flying in from D.C., in two days.

443
00:53:40,561 --> 00:53:42,186
I want something to show.

444
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:44,762
We've got a fence with a lube hose in his mouth...>>

445
00:53:44,857 --> 00:53:48,475
...automatic weapons, priors on every one of these Asian punks...>>

446
00:53:48,569 --> 00:53:51,903
...a garage full of DVD players and generally psychotic behavior.

447
00:53:51,989 --> 00:53:55,358
Tell me why we shouldn't move on Tran now and figure it out later?

448
00:53:55,451 --> 00:53:57,195
Because all we have is behavior.

449
00:53:57,286 --> 00:54:00,371
Let me get hard evidence, because what we have now is just->>

450
00:54:00,456 --> 00:54:02,449
What we have is probable cause.

451
00:54:02,542 --> 00:54:06,409
And truckers arming themselves for some good old-fashioned vigilante mayhem.

452
00:54:06,504 --> 00:54:10,584
- Tell us about Hector, Brian. - Latinos with spear guns. Give me a break.

453
00:54:10,842 --> 00:54:14,424
Hector's still working on the engines, but the tires don't match.

454
00:54:14,512 --> 00:54:16,303
Will somebody give me a cigarette?

455
00:54:16,389 --> 00:54:18,512
- Get him a cigarette. - Don't give him one.

456
00:54:18,766 --> 00:54:21,222
- I thought you quit. - I did. Just give me one.

457
00:54:21,311 --> 00:54:23,054
- Get him a cigarette. - No!

458
00:54:25,356 --> 00:54:26,981
Tell me about Toretto.

459
00:54:27,233 --> 00:54:30,020
I told you, I think he's too controlled for this.

460
00:54:30,111 --> 00:54:34,738
Going suicidal on semi-trucks? No way. Maybe Vince. But he's too dumb to do it.

461
00:54:35,116 --> 00:54:38,781
- I think the kid sister's blurring your vision. - What did you say?

462
00:54:38,870 --> 00:54:42,453
I don't blame you. I'd get off on her surveillance photos, too.

463
00:54:45,251 --> 00:54:46,496
Knock it off!

464
00:54:47,670 --> 00:54:50,208
What? Are you going native on me, Brian?

465
00:54:54,886 --> 00:54:57,128
Have you read Toretto's file lately?

466
00:54:57,389 --> 00:54:59,714
- Yeah. I memorized that file. - Read it again.

467
00:54:59,808 --> 00:55:02,215
No, better still, take a look at these.

468
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:07,389
Remember I told you about the guy he nearly beat to death?

469
00:55:07,816 --> 00:55:11,101
Toretto did this with a three-quarter-inch torque wrench.

470
00:55:11,611 --> 00:55:13,568
He's a model of self-control.

471
00:55:16,491 --> 00:55:18,199
I need a few more days.

472
00:55:20,954 --> 00:55:22,152
I need a few more days.

473
00:55:25,083 --> 00:55:26,661
Got a TR7 here, with a ball-bearing upgrade.

474
00:55:28,045 --> 00:55:31,912
What it's going to do is, it's going to spool up really quick.

475
00:55:32,090 --> 00:55:34,581
- I got this set up for 24 psi. - Got it.

476
00:55:38,096 --> 00:55:39,888
You got big plans tonight?

477
00:55:42,017 --> 00:55:44,175
Yeah. We're going out to dinner.

478
00:55:45,771 --> 00:55:48,344
You break her heart, I'll break your neck.

479
00:55:48,982 --> 00:55:50,477
That's not gonna happen.

480
00:55:55,656 --> 00:55:57,483
I want to show you something.

481
00:56:11,755 --> 00:56:13,463
Me and my dad built her.

482
00:56:14,341 --> 00:56:16,713
Nine hundred horses of Detroit muscle.

483
00:56:18,012 --> 00:56:19,257
It's a beast.

484
00:56:19,847 --> 00:56:22,717
- You know what she ran in Palmdale? - No. What?

485
00:56:22,892 --> 00:56:24,350
Nine seconds flat.

486
00:56:25,853 --> 00:56:27,976
- God. - My dad was driving.

487
00:56:28,522 --> 00:56:32,734
So much torque, the chassis twisted coming off the line.

488
00:56:33,819 --> 00:56:35,776
Barely kept her on the track.

489
00:56:36,530 --> 00:56:39,448
- So, what's your best time? - I've never driven her.

490
00:56:39,533 --> 00:56:40,613
Why not?

491
00:56:43,371 --> 00:56:45,328
It scares the shit out of me.

492
00:56:47,750 --> 00:56:48,995
That's my dad.

493
00:56:50,503 --> 00:56:53,208
He was coming up in the pro stock-car circuit.

494
00:56:53,631 --> 00:56:55,339
Last race of the season.

495
00:56:56,467 --> 00:57:00,679
A guy named Kenny Linder came up from inside, in the final turn.

496
00:57:01,514 --> 00:57:05,013
He clipped his bumper and put him into the wall at 120.

497
00:57:08,187 --> 00:57:10,559
I watched my dad burn to death.

498
00:57:13,109 --> 00:57:15,185
I remembered hearing him scream.

499
00:57:18,364 --> 00:57:22,907
But the people that were there said he had died before the tanks blew.

500
00:57:29,292 --> 00:57:31,664
They said it was me who was screaming.

501
00:57:35,214 --> 00:57:37,622
I saw Linder about a week later.

502
00:57:39,010 --> 00:57:42,426
I had a wrench, and I hit him.

503
00:57:42,764 --> 00:57:47,473
And I didn't intend to keep hitting him, but when I finished, I couldn't lift my arm.

504
00:57:52,857 --> 00:57:55,146
He's a janitor at a high school.

505
00:57:56,277 --> 00:57:58,815
He has to take the bus to work every day.

506
00:58:00,031 --> 00:58:02,736
And they banned me from the tracks for life.

507
00:58:08,373 --> 00:58:10,864
I live my life a quarter-mile at a time.

508
00:58:12,711 --> 00:58:15,498
Nothing else matters. Not the mortgage, not the store...>>

509
00:58:15,589 --> 00:58:18,080
...not my team and all their bullshit.

510
00:58:19,801 --> 00:58:22,173
For those 10 seconds or less...>>

511
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:25,340
...I'm free.

512
00:58:45,827 --> 00:58:49,078
So, how is it, anyways, that the gang came to be?

513
00:58:49,331 --> 00:58:50,446
- What? - The gang.

514
00:58:50,540 --> 00:58:52,948
The gang? No, they don't call themselves a gang.

515
00:58:53,043 --> 00:58:55,368
- What do they call themselves? - They're a team.

516
00:58:55,462 --> 00:58:59,460
- They call themselves a team. - All right. How did the team come to be?

517
00:58:59,925 --> 00:59:02,214
Well, that's a whole lot of history.

518
00:59:03,637 --> 00:59:07,338
- I've got time. - Okay. Vince grew up with my brother.

519
00:59:08,308 --> 00:59:11,428
Actually, he didn't ever actually grow up, as you can tell.

520
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:13,513
But they were friends as kids.

521
00:59:13,731 --> 00:59:16,304
And Letty, she just lived down the street.

522
00:59:16,483 --> 00:59:19,733
Always into cars, though. Ever since she was, like, 10 years old.

523
00:59:19,820 --> 00:59:23,403
So, naturally, you know, my brother always had her attention.

524
00:59:24,074 --> 00:59:27,739
- And then she turned 16- - And then she had Dom's attention.

525
00:59:28,037 --> 00:59:30,954
Yeah. It's funny how that works, isn't it?

526
00:59:31,707 --> 00:59:32,952
Yeah.

527
00:59:36,253 --> 00:59:38,744
How does Jesse fit into the whole thing?

528
00:59:38,881 --> 00:59:43,839
Jesse. Well, Jesse and Leon just sort of showed up one night and never, ever left.

529
00:59:44,678 --> 00:59:47,964
It's just the way my brother is, you know. Dom's like...>>

530
00:59:49,517 --> 00:59:51,474
He's like gravity.

531
00:59:52,603 --> 00:59:54,809
Everything just gets pulled to him.

532
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:57,816
Even you.

533
01:00:00,027 --> 01:00:01,403
No.

534
01:00:01,529 --> 01:00:02,904
No.

535
01:00:03,364 --> 01:00:06,199
The only thing that pulled me in was you.

536
01:00:06,284 --> 01:00:09,119
Being friends with your brother is just a bonus.

537
01:00:11,873 --> 01:00:13,415
That's good.

538
01:00:15,251 --> 01:00:18,786
That's good. It's nice to come first every once in a while.

539
01:00:22,425 --> 01:00:23,456
Want to go for a drive?

540
01:01:02,173 --> 01:01:04,415
- Yeah? - The hijackers have hit again.

541
01:01:04,509 --> 01:01:09,586
Bilkins has decided that we're gonna move on Johnny Tran and his guys at 17:00.

542
01:01:09,681 --> 01:01:11,555
Unless you say otherwise.

543
01:01:11,641 --> 01:01:13,515
If you agree, just say yes.

544
01:01:14,144 --> 01:01:16,136
- Yeah. - Who is that?

545
01:01:18,398 --> 01:01:20,141
It's just a wrong number.

546
01:04:12,365 --> 01:04:14,524
Yes, sir. Yeah, I know, but->>

547
01:04:14,743 --> 01:04:17,412
Yeah. Yes, sir.

548
01:04:17,620 --> 01:04:19,031
Yeah. I got it.

549
01:04:23,418 --> 01:04:25,457
The DVD players were purchased legally.

550
01:04:25,545 --> 01:04:28,795
All we've got are a couple of low-rent weapons charges...>>

551
01:04:28,882 --> 01:04:31,171
...and some outstanding speeding tickets.

552
01:04:31,259 --> 01:04:32,919
- So, they're out. - Yeah.

553
01:04:33,136 --> 01:04:34,714
Father bailed them out.

554
01:04:35,847 --> 01:04:39,596
Is this the kind of intelligence I can expect from you, O'Conner?

555
01:04:44,439 --> 01:04:47,606
- You're gonna put this on me? - I can put it on whoever I want to.

556
01:04:47,692 --> 01:04:50,397
- Perks of the job. - No, you can't put this on me->>

557
01:04:50,487 --> 01:04:52,361
No, wait a minute. Let me tell you.

558
01:04:52,447 --> 01:04:56,659
I don't care if you have to aim at someone and blow your cover to smithereens.

559
01:04:56,743 --> 01:04:59,281
You've got 36 hours to crack this bastard...>>

560
01:04:59,371 --> 01:05:02,455
...or you might want to think about another career.

561
01:05:13,510 --> 01:05:16,926
It's Toretto, Brian. It always has been Toretto.

562
01:05:18,307 --> 01:05:20,180
Tran and Hector are...>>

563
01:05:20,601 --> 01:05:22,392
They're just fumes.

564
01:05:25,647 --> 01:05:28,352
I know you've been lying to me. My question is this:>>

565
01:05:28,442 --> 01:05:32,107
Have you been lying to yourself because you can't see past Mia?

566
01:05:34,740 --> 01:05:36,733
He won't go back to prison.

567
01:05:37,701 --> 01:05:40,572
Well, that's a choice he's going to have to make.

568
01:05:44,667 --> 01:05:47,074
There's all kinds of family, Brian.

569
01:05:48,504 --> 01:05:51,291
And that's a choice you're gonna have to make.

570
01:06:09,316 --> 01:06:11,309
You ready for this?

571
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:40,555
Nice car. What's the retail on one of those?

572
01:06:41,182 --> 01:06:43,755
More than you can afford, pal. Ferrari.

573
01:06:49,941 --> 01:06:51,435
Smoke him.

574
01:07:46,373 --> 01:07:48,164
So, what's wrong, Brian?

575
01:07:49,125 --> 01:07:50,833
Nothing, man, I'm fine.

576
01:07:51,294 --> 01:07:54,544
Come on. Obviously something's off.

577
01:07:55,090 --> 01:07:58,790
Look, I have my good days and bad days just like anybody else.

578
01:07:59,469 --> 01:08:03,052
Brian, don't lose that cool of yours. That's your meal ticket.

579
01:08:05,016 --> 01:08:07,852
My meal ticket? I can't pay for my own shrimp?

580
01:08:08,019 --> 01:08:09,478
I got the shrimp.

581
01:08:09,896 --> 01:08:12,470
No, that's one thing about me you don't understand.

582
01:08:12,566 --> 01:08:16,231
I don't take handouts. I earn my way, every step.

583
01:08:17,154 --> 01:08:19,526
I need something extra on the side, like you.

584
01:08:19,615 --> 01:08:21,572
What do you mean, like me?

585
01:08:21,867 --> 01:08:24,737
- What's that supposed to mean? - That's what I mean.

586
01:08:24,828 --> 01:08:27,533
- What does that mean, like me? - Don't try->>

587
01:08:27,831 --> 01:08:29,740
I'm not stupid, all right?

588
01:08:30,125 --> 01:08:34,205
I know that there's no way you paid for all that shit you got under the hood->>

589
01:08:34,296 --> 01:08:37,665
There's no way you paid for what's under the hood of those cars...>>

590
01:08:37,758 --> 01:08:40,510
...by doing tune-ups and selling groceries.

591
01:08:41,345 --> 01:08:44,346
Whatever it is you're in on, I want in on it, too.

592
01:09:07,204 --> 01:09:09,280
- Well, what is this? - Read it.

593
01:09:10,082 --> 01:09:12,371
- What is this for? - It's directions.

594
01:09:14,378 --> 01:09:16,086
To Race Wars.

595
01:09:16,589 --> 01:09:18,380
We'll see how you go.

596
01:09:19,383 --> 01:09:21,008
Then we'll talk.

597
01:10:07,306 --> 01:10:08,931
- How's it going? - What's up?

598
01:10:09,017 --> 01:10:11,686
- Welcome to Race Wars. - Great. Thanks a lot.

599
01:10:35,085 --> 01:10:36,792
Baby. Hey, baby.

600
01:10:37,962 --> 01:10:39,789
You should watch from the side.

601
01:10:39,881 --> 01:10:42,337
I wouldn't want to get exhaust on that pretty face.

602
01:10:42,425 --> 01:10:46,505
- Put your money where your mouth is. - I'll race you for that sweet little ass.

603
01:10:46,596 --> 01:10:49,052
You want ass, why don't you hit Hollywood Boulevard?

604
01:10:49,140 --> 01:10:52,225
You want an adrenaline rush, it'll be two large.

605
01:10:52,310 --> 01:10:55,311
Right here. Right now. What's it gonna be?

606
01:10:57,983 --> 01:10:59,393
You got it.

607
01:11:19,421 --> 01:11:21,460
"Another one bites the dust">>

608
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:26,669
Come on. What you got?

609
01:11:27,387 --> 01:11:28,846
See ya.

610
01:12:04,842 --> 01:12:07,796
- What's up? - Hey, what's up, Jesse?

611
01:12:08,262 --> 01:12:09,542
What's in your hand?

612
01:12:09,638 --> 01:12:12,010
Throwing down the pink slip, just like you.

613
01:12:12,099 --> 01:12:14,720
- The pink slip to what? The Jetta? - Yeah.

614
01:12:15,144 --> 01:12:17,682
- You can't bet your dad's car. - It's all right.

615
01:12:17,771 --> 01:12:19,052
I ain't losing.

616
01:12:19,148 --> 01:12:22,647
This fool is running a Honda 2000. I'll win.

617
01:12:22,818 --> 01:12:27,361
That way, me and my dad can roll when he gets out of prison. It's all good.

618
01:12:27,448 --> 01:12:31,066
They're gonna throw him right back in prison after he kills you.

619
01:12:38,709 --> 01:12:40,666
You visualize the win.

620
01:12:40,753 --> 01:12:44,418
Visualize the win, Jesse. I'm serious. You got to listen to me, man.

621
01:12:44,507 --> 01:12:46,049
Who are you racing?

622
01:12:50,429 --> 01:12:52,636
Jesse, don't do it.

623
01:12:52,765 --> 01:12:56,430
I bet you he's got more than $100,000 under the hood of that car.

624
01:13:19,584 --> 01:13:21,161
Too soon, junior.

625
01:13:24,797 --> 01:13:25,663
No!

626
01:13:28,801 --> 01:13:30,000
Shit!

627
01:13:30,637 --> 01:13:31,799
Oh, God!

628
01:13:42,232 --> 01:13:44,901
Yo! Heads up, bro. We got problems.

629
01:13:44,984 --> 01:13:46,728
- What? - Jesse.

630
01:13:48,238 --> 01:13:50,277
Where's Jesse going?

631
01:13:50,448 --> 01:13:53,948
- He just raced Tran for slips. - Oh, shit.

632
01:14:05,630 --> 01:14:08,750
- Where's he going? - He went to the car wash.

633
01:14:08,967 --> 01:14:10,924
Whatever. Go fetch my car.

634
01:14:11,511 --> 01:14:13,136
Go fetch your car?

635
01:14:14,097 --> 01:14:15,757
We're not on your block.

636
01:14:15,849 --> 01:14:18,470
You better watch who you talk to like that.

637
01:14:19,019 --> 01:14:20,133
Toretto!

638
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:25,314
SWAT came into my house...>>

639
01:14:26,276 --> 01:14:30,523
...disrespected my whole family, because somebody narked me out.

640
01:14:31,239 --> 01:14:33,695
And you know what? It was you!

641
01:14:58,058 --> 01:15:00,098
Get off of him, man.

642
01:15:09,445 --> 01:15:11,236
Dom, chill out, man. Come on!

643
01:15:11,322 --> 01:15:13,113
I never narked on nobody!

644
01:15:13,240 --> 01:15:15,731
I never narked on nobody!

645
01:15:54,740 --> 01:15:55,820
Mia.

646
01:16:00,580 --> 01:16:02,952
I have respected you and I haven't said shit.

647
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:04,784
Now I am asking you not to go.

648
01:16:04,876 --> 01:16:07,746
- I'm doing this for both of us. - Don't give me that crap.

649
01:16:07,837 --> 01:16:09,296
You're doing this for you.

650
01:16:09,380 --> 01:16:13,508
Why are you insisting on doing this? Dom, please, just don't.

651
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:27,971
- Mia, what's going on? - What?

652
01:16:28,066 --> 01:16:30,557
- You know what I'm talking about. - No, I don't.

653
01:16:30,652 --> 01:16:33,902
You always have tears in your eyes when Dom drives away?

654
01:16:34,030 --> 01:16:35,572
What's the matter with you?

655
01:16:35,657 --> 01:16:38,230
What's he racing off in the middle of the night for?

656
01:16:38,326 --> 01:16:41,493
- You know about the trucks? - No, Brian! What trucks?

657
01:16:41,579 --> 01:16:45,447
- Jesus Christ. What? - Listen to me.

658
01:16:46,709 --> 01:16:48,168
Mia, I'm a cop.

659
01:16:49,712 --> 01:16:52,382
What are you talking about, Brian? What is this?

660
01:16:52,465 --> 01:16:55,917
Ever since the first time I met you, I've been undercover.

661
01:16:57,178 --> 01:16:58,376
I'm a cop.

662
01:17:03,435 --> 01:17:05,059
Oh, you bastard.

663
01:17:07,897 --> 01:17:09,178
You bastard.

664
01:17:11,568 --> 01:17:13,395
- Mia. - Get off of me, Brian!

665
01:17:13,486 --> 01:17:15,230
Mia! Listen to me!

666
01:17:16,489 --> 01:17:19,063
Everything I ever said I felt about you was real.

667
01:17:19,159 --> 01:17:21,780
I swear to God. You have to believe me, Mia.

668
01:17:21,870 --> 01:17:25,488
But this isn't about you and me. Your brother's out there to pull a job.

669
01:17:25,582 --> 01:17:29,033
We're running out of time. Those truckers aren't laying down anymore.

670
01:17:29,127 --> 01:17:32,876
Maybe they'll make it through tonight, but every law enforcement agency...>>

671
01:17:32,964 --> 01:17:34,672
...is coming down on them.

672
01:17:34,758 --> 01:17:37,675
If you don't want anything to happen to them...>>

673
01:17:37,761 --> 01:17:40,845
...you have to get in that car with me right now and help me.

674
01:17:42,391 --> 01:17:45,724
Mia, you are the only person that can help me right now.

675
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:49,853
Please, Mia. Please help me.

676
01:18:01,785 --> 01:18:04,620
Civics are stashed somewhere outside of Thermal.

677
01:18:04,705 --> 01:18:07,990
They wouldn't double back, and Highway 10 is too well patrolled.

678
01:18:08,083 --> 01:18:11,037
- So, what does that leave us with? - All this.

679
01:18:19,970 --> 01:18:22,841
- Nextel. - This is Officer Brian O'Conner.

680
01:18:23,015 --> 01:18:27,392
Serial number 34762. I need a cell phone trace.

681
01:18:27,603 --> 01:18:30,639
- Okay. What's the cell number? - Mia, what is it?

682
01:18:32,775 --> 01:18:35,941
Come on, Mia. She needs Dom's cell phone number now.

683
01:18:39,281 --> 01:18:43,990
323-555-6439.

684
01:18:45,079 --> 01:18:47,652
Thank you. Yeah, you get that?

685
01:19:13,858 --> 01:19:17,690
All right, we're one man short. Letty, I need you on the left side.

686
01:19:19,989 --> 01:19:23,323
Your sister's right about this one. This don't feel good.

687
01:19:23,451 --> 01:19:27,579
- Don't do that. - Something's wrong.

688
01:19:27,663 --> 01:19:30,499
- Stop. - We shouldn't be doing this without Jesse.

689
01:19:31,626 --> 01:19:34,580
This is the mother lode. We've been on this for three months.

690
01:19:34,670 --> 01:19:37,162
After this, it's a long vacation for everyone.

691
01:19:37,256 --> 01:19:39,214
- Let's go. - I hope so.

692
01:19:42,762 --> 01:19:45,846
Listen, the other night I had a dream...>>

693
01:19:46,349 --> 01:19:49,054
...that you and I were on the beach in Mexico.

694
01:19:49,435 --> 01:19:51,475
- Really? - Really.

695
01:19:54,649 --> 01:19:56,807
Come on. Let's make this happen.

696
01:19:59,904 --> 01:20:04,400
- Leon, keep on those scanners. - Copy that.

697
01:20:07,954 --> 01:20:09,994
All right, let's go.

698
01:20:20,592 --> 01:20:23,676
Okay, we traced the number to the northbound 86.

699
01:20:23,762 --> 01:20:28,258
Mile 114, outside Coachella. We'll keep the trace open, Officer.

700
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:30,011
Let me see this.

701
01:20:34,814 --> 01:20:37,056
I think we're about 40 miles away.

702
01:20:37,484 --> 01:20:39,108
What are you gonna do?

703
01:20:40,403 --> 01:20:42,396
What are you gonna do?

704
01:21:14,688 --> 01:21:16,764
Okay! Go time!

705
01:21:32,456 --> 01:21:34,912
We're all good. I got nothing on the scanners.

706
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:36,281
Keep going.

707
01:21:50,850 --> 01:21:52,012
Vince!

708
01:21:52,685 --> 01:21:54,761
Vince, don't! Get back in!

709
01:21:56,355 --> 01:21:57,470
Vince!

710
01:22:03,112 --> 01:22:04,820
He's got a damn shotgun! Leon!

711
01:22:04,905 --> 01:22:07,194
Back off! Get him off of there!

712
01:22:09,869 --> 01:22:11,149
Oh, shit!

713
01:22:22,214 --> 01:22:24,884
Get me off this thing! Pull up!

714
01:22:26,010 --> 01:22:29,344
Unhook yourself. Do it!

715
01:22:29,722 --> 01:22:31,715
- Do it! - I can't get->>

716
01:22:31,808 --> 01:22:33,183
You can do it!

717
01:22:34,227 --> 01:22:35,685
Come on, Vince!

718
01:22:43,194 --> 01:22:45,767
Dom! I'm pulling up to distract him!

719
01:22:53,246 --> 01:22:54,705
Come on, boy!

720
01:22:55,915 --> 01:22:58,038
Shot doesn't get better than this.

721
01:23:03,089 --> 01:23:04,370
Son of a bitch!

722
01:23:09,220 --> 01:23:11,546
Take me off here, or I'll have to unhook the wire!

723
01:23:11,639 --> 01:23:15,886
Try it again. One, two, three!

724
01:23:27,906 --> 01:23:29,483
Unhook yourself!

725
01:23:31,242 --> 01:23:33,116
I can't get my arm free!

726
01:23:33,203 --> 01:23:35,445
- Vince, grab my hand! - My arm!

727
01:23:35,538 --> 01:23:37,330
Listen, give me your hand.

728
01:23:37,499 --> 01:23:39,954
I'm gonna pull you off the rig!

729
01:23:43,129 --> 01:23:44,754
Vince!

730
01:23:44,840 --> 01:23:46,832
Hold on!

731
01:23:46,925 --> 01:23:49,048
Give me your hand! Listen to me!

732
01:23:55,892 --> 01:23:56,888
Dominic!

733
01:23:56,977 --> 01:23:58,175
Shit!

734
01:24:01,732 --> 01:24:03,855
- Dominic! - Hang on!

735
01:24:04,443 --> 01:24:07,360
Dom! Move out of the way. I'm coming to get him.

736
01:24:32,471 --> 01:24:33,799
Letty!

737
01:24:34,598 --> 01:24:35,629
Leon!

738
01:24:35,724 --> 01:24:36,803
Pull back for Letty.

739
01:24:36,892 --> 01:24:38,172
Get her out of there!

740
01:24:38,268 --> 01:24:39,679
I'm on it! Go!

741
01:24:48,862 --> 01:24:51,532
I've got her! You get Vince off that truck.

742
01:24:56,871 --> 01:24:59,112
Letty! Come on, baby.

743
01:25:00,165 --> 01:25:01,245
You okay?

744
01:25:01,333 --> 01:25:03,741
Oh, shit. Come on, girl, you all right?

745
01:25:03,836 --> 01:25:07,419
Come on, let me look at you. Come on. We got to go. Let's go.

746
01:25:21,228 --> 01:25:22,723
Vince!

747
01:25:51,008 --> 01:25:52,171
Take the wheel.

748
01:25:52,260 --> 01:25:54,965
- What do you mean? - Put your foot on the gas!

749
01:25:55,722 --> 01:25:58,010
I'm gonna get him. Put your foot on the gas!

750
01:25:58,099 --> 01:25:59,344
Okay!

751
01:26:02,729 --> 01:26:05,813
- Come on. Keep it steady. - I got it!

752
01:26:07,358 --> 01:26:09,315
All right, hold on, Vince.

753
01:26:10,111 --> 01:26:13,029
He's having a hard time holding on. Get me a little closer.

754
01:26:13,114 --> 01:26:14,395
All right.

755
01:26:15,241 --> 01:26:17,400
- Closer. - I'm moving in.

756
01:26:17,785 --> 01:26:19,363
Hold it right there!

757
01:26:20,205 --> 01:26:21,284
Go!

758
01:26:23,458 --> 01:26:26,031
You got to hang in here with me now!

759
01:26:26,127 --> 01:26:28,286
We'll get you off. Give me your arm!

760
01:26:28,379 --> 01:26:30,538
Vince, look at me! Don't let go!

761
01:26:34,511 --> 01:26:37,084
Come on, Vince! Throw this arm around me!

762
01:26:37,889 --> 01:26:40,214
Vince, don't let go!

763
01:26:44,437 --> 01:26:46,513
Come on, Mia. Get closer!

764
01:26:52,070 --> 01:26:53,778
Mia, get closer! Come on.

765
01:26:53,864 --> 01:26:55,737
Come on, Vince. Here we go!

766
01:27:23,810 --> 01:27:25,091
Shit.

767
01:27:28,732 --> 01:27:32,267
It's gonna be okay, Letty. I love you.

768
01:27:35,531 --> 01:27:37,155
- Watch her. - I got her.

769
01:27:38,075 --> 01:27:40,613
Come on, Vince! Hang in there! Come on!

770
01:27:44,790 --> 01:27:47,957
If he doesn't get to an ambulance in 10 minutes, he's dead.

771
01:27:48,043 --> 01:27:50,499
- Hold the pressure. Hold his arm up. - I got it.

772
01:27:56,427 --> 01:27:59,381
Yeah. Yeah, this is Officer Brian O'Conner.

773
01:27:59,596 --> 01:28:02,052
I'm off-duty MAPD.

774
01:28:02,182 --> 01:28:04,970
I need a life flight roll out right away.

775
01:28:06,103 --> 01:28:10,397
My 20 is Highway 86, mile marker 147.

776
01:28:10,941 --> 01:28:13,978
I got one trauma victim, about 24 years of age.

777
01:28:14,069 --> 01:28:16,643
Six-foot, maybe 200 pounds.

778
01:28:16,822 --> 01:28:20,571
He's got a deep laceration to his right arm with arterial bleeding.

779
01:28:20,659 --> 01:28:25,037
And he's got a shotgun wound close range to his left flank.

780
01:28:26,957 --> 01:28:28,867
Yeah, he's going into shock!

781
01:30:08,935 --> 01:30:10,845
Dom, put the gun down now!

782
01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:15,267
- Move your car. - No bullshit!

783
01:30:15,358 --> 01:30:17,814
Put it down now! No more running!

784
01:30:17,944 --> 01:30:19,487
I'm not running!

785
01:30:22,616 --> 01:30:25,023
- Where's Leon and Letty? - They're long gone!

786
01:30:25,118 --> 01:30:28,155
Then it's over. I didn't call the police, but don't push me!

787
01:30:28,246 --> 01:30:31,164
- Put the gun down. I swear to God! - You are the cop!

788
01:30:31,249 --> 01:30:32,660
You're a cop!

789
01:30:34,253 --> 01:30:37,622
Brian, I got to find Jesse before they do.

790
01:30:37,714 --> 01:30:40,585
- I'm all the kid's got. - I'll call in the plates.

791
01:30:40,676 --> 01:30:44,376
PD will pick him up way before Johnny even gets near him.

792
01:30:44,555 --> 01:30:48,006
- Move your car. - Dom, stop it! It's over. Please.

793
01:30:48,142 --> 01:30:49,849
Mia, stay out of it!

794
01:30:55,399 --> 01:30:58,602
Dominic, I am so sorry.

795
01:30:58,986 --> 01:31:01,192
I don't know what I'm doing, Dom.

796
01:31:01,280 --> 01:31:05,527
I'm so scared right now. I don't know what's going on.

797
01:31:05,617 --> 01:31:08,369
What were you thinking, man?

798
01:31:08,454 --> 01:31:10,945
I don't know! I panicked! I'm sorry.

799
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:12,949
I'm scared!

800
01:31:13,042 --> 01:31:16,126
I don't know what I'm doing! Will you please help me?

801
01:31:20,674 --> 01:31:22,169
Dom!

802
01:31:41,028 --> 01:31:42,357
Jesse!

803
01:31:42,446 --> 01:31:43,941
No, Jesse!

804
01:31:58,671 --> 01:32:00,296
No, Dom, no!

805
01:34:55,182 --> 01:34:58,551
Call 911. You call 911!

806
01:35:33,388 --> 01:35:36,139
I used to drag here back in high school.

807
01:35:36,849 --> 01:35:41,013
That railroad crossing up there is exactly a quarter mile away from here.

808
01:35:42,188 --> 01:35:44,810
On green, I'm going for it.

809
01:38:19,388 --> 01:38:21,630
That's not what I had in mind.

810
01:39:08,188 --> 01:39:10,097
You know what you're doing?

811
01:39:10,565 --> 01:39:12,641
I owe you a 10-second car.
