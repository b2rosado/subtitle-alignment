2
00:01:35,589 --> 00:01:38,133
Excuse me, sir, is there a commode?

3
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:48,810
Justin!

4
00:01:48,894 --> 00:01:51,938
Quick, honey, take my picture.
I got the pyramid in my hand.

5
00:02:01,114 --> 00:02:03,241
Justin, you get back here right now!

6
00:02:03,658 --> 00:02:04,701
No, stop!

7
00:02:04,784 --> 00:02:07,204
- No, no! Stop him!
- Go back! Don't climb!

8
00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:13,001
Wait, wait.

9
00:02:13,084 --> 00:02:15,128
Hold on. Easy, little boy.

10
00:02:16,504 --> 00:02:18,757
Okay, stop, child! Stop right there. No!

11
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:23,011
No, no, no! There he goes. 

12
00:02:34,564 --> 00:02:35,732
Justin!

13
00:02:44,407 --> 00:02:46,201
I've got him! I've got him!

14
00:02:57,128 --> 00:02:59,589
Outrage in Egypt tonight
as it was discovered

15
00:02:59,673 --> 00:03:02,425
that the Great Pyramid of Giza
had been stolen

16
00:03:02,509 --> 00:03:05,345
and replaced by a giant inflatable replica.

17
00:03:05,595 --> 00:03:08,598
There is panic throughout the globe
as countries and citizens

18
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:11,768
try to protect their beloved landmarks.

19
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:14,854
Law enforcement still has no leads,

20
00:03:14,938 --> 00:03:17,315
leaving everyone to wonder,
which of the world's villains

21
00:03:17,399 --> 00:03:19,943
is responsible for this heinous crime?

22
00:03:20,235 --> 00:03:22,028
And where will he strike next?

23
00:04:10,952 --> 00:04:13,371
I'm having a bad, bad day

24
00:04:13,455 --> 00:04:16,499
It's about time that I get my way

25
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:19,169
Steamrolling whatever I see

26
00:04:19,836 --> 00:04:22,505
Freeze ray! Freeze ray! Freeze ray!

27
00:04:22,589 --> 00:04:24,716
I'm having a bad, bad day

28
00:04:24,799 --> 00:04:27,844
If you take it personal, that's okay

29
00:04:27,928 --> 00:04:30,513
Watch, this is so fun to see

30
00:04:31,681 --> 00:04:33,225
Despicable me

31
00:04:58,291 --> 00:05:00,252
Morning, Gru!

32
00:05:01,711 --> 00:05:02,754
How you doing?

33
00:05:02,837 --> 00:05:04,839
Hello, Fred.

34
00:05:04,923 --> 00:05:09,970
FYI, your dog has been leaving
little bombs all over my yard,

35
00:05:10,053 --> 00:05:12,138
and I don't appreciate it.

36
00:05:12,222 --> 00:05:15,850
Sorry. You know dogs.
They go wherever they want to go.

37
00:05:15,934 --> 00:05:17,686
Unless they're dead.

38
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:21,398
I'm joking!

39
00:05:22,524 --> 00:05:25,402
Although, it is true.
Anyway, have a good one.

40
00:05:26,278 --> 00:05:28,905
Okay. Yeah.

41
00:05:29,739 --> 00:05:32,909
Steamrolling whatever I see

42
00:05:33,827 --> 00:05:35,245
Despicable me

43
00:05:35,704 --> 00:05:38,123
I'm having a bad, bad day

44
00:05:38,206 --> 00:05:40,834
If you take it personal, that's okay

45
00:05:45,171 --> 00:05:46,840
Despicable me

46
00:05:52,762 --> 00:05:55,390
You've got to be pulling on my leg!

47
00:05:59,227 --> 00:06:00,270
Hello!

48
00:06:01,313 --> 00:06:03,189
Cookies for sale.

49
00:06:05,317 --> 00:06:07,527
Go away. I'm not home.

50
00:06:07,944 --> 00:06:10,363
Yes, you are. I heard you.

51
00:06:11,239 --> 00:06:14,284
No, you didn't. This

52
00:06:14,367 --> 00:06:16,286
is a recording.

53
00:06:16,369 --> 00:06:18,622
- No, it isn't.
- Yes, it is.

54
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:23,293
Watch this. Leave a message, beep.

55
00:06:27,088 --> 00:06:28,882
Goodbye, recorded message.

56
00:06:28,965 --> 00:06:30,800
Agnes, come on.

57
00:06:41,561 --> 00:06:42,604
Kyle!

58
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:46,650
Bad dog! No! No, no. Sit. My muffin.

59
00:06:46,733 --> 00:06:47,859
Gru!

60
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,487
Dr Nefario.

61
00:06:50,654 --> 00:06:52,239
I know how you must be feelíng.

62
00:06:52,322 --> 00:06:55,784
I, too, have encountered
great disappointment,

63
00:06:56,451 --> 00:07:00,288
but in my eyes,
you will always be one of the greats.

64
00:07:00,956 --> 00:07:02,415
What? What happened?

65
00:07:02,499 --> 00:07:03,917
It's all over the news!

66
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,002
Some fella just stole a pyramid.

67
00:07:06,086 --> 00:07:09,339
They're saying he makes
all other villains look

68
00:07:10,173 --> 00:07:11,675
lame.

69
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:16,054
Assemble the minions!

70
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:48,545
Minions, assemble!

71
00:07:49,588 --> 00:07:51,047
Okay. Okay.

72
00:07:58,096 --> 00:07:59,222
Hey!

73
00:08:46,645 --> 00:08:49,314
Looking good, Kevin!
How is the family? Good?

74
00:08:49,397 --> 00:08:50,607
All right.

75
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:53,693
That's my Billy boy! What up, Larry?

76
00:08:54,736 --> 00:08:56,780
Hello, everybody!

77
00:08:56,863 --> 00:08:58,740
Yeah, all right!

78
00:08:58,823 --> 00:09:01,159
Simmer down. Simmer down!

79
00:09:01,243 --> 00:09:03,119
Thank you, okay.

80
00:09:03,203 --> 00:09:06,122
Now, I realise that you guys probably heard

81
00:09:06,206 --> 00:09:08,959
about this other villain
who stole the pyramids.

82
00:09:09,042 --> 00:09:11,378
Apparently, it's a big deal.

83
00:09:11,461 --> 00:09:14,881
People are calling it
the crime of the century and stuff like that.

84
00:09:14,965 --> 00:09:19,135
But am I upset? No, I am not!

85
00:09:20,637 --> 00:09:22,055
A little,

86
00:09:22,138 --> 00:09:26,059
but we have had
a pretty good year ourselves,

87
00:09:26,142 --> 00:09:29,062
and you guys are all right in my book.

88
00:09:30,146 --> 00:09:31,398
No, no raises!

89
00:09:31,481 --> 00:09:34,651
You're not going to get any raises.

90
00:09:35,485 --> 00:09:37,153
What did we do?

91
00:09:37,237 --> 00:09:43,243
Well, we stole the Times Square JumboTron!

92
00:09:43,702 --> 00:09:44,953
Nice!

93
00:09:46,621 --> 00:09:48,665
That's how I roll.

94
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,752
Yeah, you all like watching football
on that, huh?

95
00:09:53,545 --> 00:09:54,963
But that's not all.

96
00:09:55,046 --> 00:09:58,341
We stole the Statue of Liberty,

97
00:10:00,051 --> 00:10:02,429
the small one from Las Vegas.

98
00:10:04,598 --> 00:10:08,602
And I won't even mention the Eiffel Tower!
Also Vegas.

99
00:10:08,685 --> 00:10:11,479
Okay, I wasn't going to tell you
about this yet,

100
00:10:11,563 --> 00:10:16,234
but I have been working
on something very big!

101
00:10:17,193 --> 00:10:21,531
Something that will blow this pyramid thing
out of the water!

102
00:10:22,115 --> 00:10:26,494
And thanks to the efforts
of my good friend Dr Nefario...

103
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,330
Thank you!

104
00:10:28,413 --> 00:10:29,706
There he is.

105
00:10:29,789 --> 00:10:31,249
He's styling.

106
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:35,212
Now, we have located a shrink ray

107
00:10:35,295 --> 00:10:39,925
in a secret lab,
and once we take this shrink ray,

108
00:10:40,217 --> 00:10:43,428
we will have the capability

109
00:10:43,511 --> 00:10:47,474
to pull off the true crime of the century.

110
00:10:48,225 --> 00:10:50,685
We are going to steal...

111
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:57,609
Wait, wait! I haven't told you what it is yet.

112
00:11:00,987 --> 00:11:02,030
Hey.

113
00:11:02,113 --> 00:11:04,241
Dave, listen up, please.

114
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:12,290
Next, we are going to steal,

115
00:11:12,374 --> 00:11:14,709
pause for effect,

116
00:11:15,502 --> 00:11:17,671
the moon!

117
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,717
And once the moon is mine,

118
00:11:23,176 --> 00:11:27,514
the world will give me
whatever I want to get it back!

119
00:11:27,597 --> 00:11:32,936
And I will be the greatest villain of all time!

120
00:11:35,939 --> 00:11:40,151
That's what I'm talking about.

121
00:11:41,778 --> 00:11:42,863
Yes?

122
00:11:42,946 --> 00:11:46,700
Hello, Gru?
I've been crunching some numbers,

123
00:11:46,783 --> 00:11:49,953
and I really don't see how we can afford this.

124
00:11:50,036 --> 00:11:52,831
It can't be done. I'm not a miracle worker.

125
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:54,916
Hey, chillax.

126
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,628
I'll iust get another loan from the bank.
They love me!

127
00:12:14,311 --> 00:12:16,021
Edith, stop it!

128
00:12:16,104 --> 00:12:18,189
What? I'm just walking.

129
00:12:30,994 --> 00:12:33,121
- Hi, Miss Hattie. We're back.
- Hi, Miss Hattie. We're back.

130
00:12:35,999 --> 00:12:37,500
Hello, girls!

131
00:12:37,584 --> 00:12:40,420
Anybody come to adopt us
while we were out?

132
00:12:41,338 --> 00:12:43,340
Let me think.

133
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,925
No!

134
00:12:48,136 --> 00:12:51,223
Edith! What did you put on my desk?

135
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,308
A mud pie.

136
00:12:54,059 --> 00:12:57,979
You're never gonna get adopted, Edith.
You know that, don't you?

137
00:12:58,063 --> 00:13:00,357
- Yeah, I know.
- Good.

138
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:04,027
So, how did it go, girls?
Did we meet our quotas?

139
00:13:04,861 --> 00:13:06,196
Sort of.

140
00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:10,534
We sold 43 mini-mints, 30 choco-swirlies,
and 18 coco-nutties.

141
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:14,621
Okay.

142
00:13:14,996 --> 00:13:18,875
Well, you say that like it's a great sale day.

143
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,127
Look at my face!

144
00:13:21,211 --> 00:13:24,464
Do you still think it's a great sale day?

145
00:13:25,382 --> 00:13:27,384
Eighteen coco-nutties.

146
00:13:27,801 --> 00:13:32,472
I think we can do a little better than that,
don't you?

147
00:13:33,306 --> 00:13:34,349
Yeah.

148
00:13:34,432 --> 00:13:38,812
We wouldn't want to spend the weekend
in the Box of Shame, would we? No.

149
00:13:39,229 --> 00:13:40,397
- No, Miss Hattie.
- No, Miss Hattie.

150
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,192
Okay, good. Off you go.
Go clean something of mine.

151
00:13:46,236 --> 00:13:47,487
- Hi, Penny.
- Hi, Penny.

152
00:13:47,571 --> 00:13:48,738
Hi, guys.

153
00:13:53,702 --> 00:13:56,913
Hello, Mom. Sorry, I meant to call, but...

154
00:13:57,247 --> 00:14:00,542
I iust wanted to congratulate you
on stealing the pyramid.

155
00:14:01,585 --> 00:14:03,003
That was you, wasn't it?

156
00:14:03,295 --> 00:14:06,882
Or was it a villain who's actually successful?

157
00:14:08,008 --> 00:14:10,760
Just so you know, Mom,
I am about to do something

158
00:14:10,844 --> 00:14:13,597
that's very, very big, very important.

159
00:14:13,972 --> 00:14:16,766
When you hear about it,
you're going to be very proud.

160
00:14:18,268 --> 00:14:21,479
Good luck with that. Okay, I'm out of here.

161
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,925
Gru to see Mr Perkins.

162
00:15:32,342 --> 00:15:34,427
Yes, please have a seat.

163
00:15:46,022 --> 00:15:48,400
That's one small step for man,

164
00:15:51,319 --> 00:15:53,029
one giant leap for mankind.

165
00:15:53,154 --> 00:15:55,907
Ma, someday I'm going to go to the moon.

166
00:15:56,533 --> 00:15:58,869
I'm afraid you're too late, Son.

167
00:15:59,202 --> 00:16:01,663
NASA isn't sending the monkeys any more.

168
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:11,464
Hey.

169
00:16:18,889 --> 00:16:23,059
I'm applying for a new villain loan.
Go by the name of Vector.

170
00:16:27,689 --> 00:16:29,190
It's a mathematical term,

171
00:16:29,274 --> 00:16:33,778
a quantity represented by an arrow,
with both direction and magnitude.

172
00:16:37,741 --> 00:16:39,784
Vector! That's me,

173
00:16:39,868 --> 00:16:45,123
'cause I'm committing crimes
with both direction and magnitude.

174
00:16:45,207 --> 00:16:46,875
Oh, yeah!

175
00:16:49,002 --> 00:16:50,629
Check out my new weapon.

176
00:16:50,712 --> 00:16:52,964
Piranha gun! Oh, yes!

177
00:16:53,048 --> 00:16:56,801
Fires live piranhas. Ever seen one before?
No, you haven't. I invented it.

178
00:16:56,885 --> 00:16:59,054
Do you want a demonstration?

179
00:17:00,013 --> 00:17:04,267
Shoot! So difficult, sometimes,
to get the piranha back inside of my...

180
00:17:04,351 --> 00:17:06,811
Mr Gru, Mr Perkins will see you now.

181
00:17:07,812 --> 00:17:09,022
So, all I need

182
00:17:09,105 --> 00:17:12,150
is money from the bank to build a rocket.

183
00:17:12,234 --> 00:17:15,195
- And then, the moon is ours.
- Wow!

184
00:17:16,071 --> 00:17:17,948
Well, very nice presentation.

185
00:17:18,031 --> 00:17:20,325
I'd like to see this shrink ray.

186
00:17:20,408 --> 00:17:24,496
Absolutely! Will do. Soon as I have it.

187
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:27,541
You don't have it?

188
00:17:27,624 --> 00:17:31,294
And yet you have the audacity
to ask the bank for money?

189
00:17:32,337 --> 00:17:33,880
Apparently.

190
00:17:33,964 --> 00:17:38,301
Do you have any idea of the capital
that this bank has invested in you, Gru?

191
00:17:39,344 --> 00:17:43,974
With far too few of your sinister plots
actually turning a profit.

192
00:17:44,808 --> 00:17:48,645
How can I put it? Let's say this apple is you.

193
00:17:49,187 --> 00:17:51,690
If we don't start getting our money back...

194
00:17:53,525 --> 00:17:55,235
Get the picture?

195
00:17:56,653 --> 00:18:00,240
Look, Gru, the point is,
there are a lot of new villains out there,

196
00:18:00,532 --> 00:18:03,368
younger than you, hungrier than you,

197
00:18:03,451 --> 00:18:05,495
younger than you.

198
00:18:05,579 --> 00:18:07,873
Like that young fellow out there
named Vector.

199
00:18:07,956 --> 00:18:09,541
He just stole a pyramid!

200
00:18:14,087 --> 00:18:16,172
I've got it. I've got it.

201
00:18:17,507 --> 00:18:20,176
So, as far as getting money for the rocket...

202
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:23,263
Get the shrink ray, then we'll talk.

203
00:19:53,061 --> 00:19:54,312
Suckers!

204
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,694
Suckers!

205
00:20:07,617 --> 00:20:08,910
We got it!

206
00:20:15,959 --> 00:20:17,085
What?

207
00:20:17,168 --> 00:20:19,963
Hey! Hey! What! Hey!

208
00:20:21,673 --> 00:20:22,716
No, no, no!

209
00:20:26,261 --> 00:20:27,429
You!

210
00:20:30,348 --> 00:20:34,185
Now, maybe you'll think twice
before you freeze someone's head!

211
00:20:34,269 --> 00:20:36,062
So long, Gru!

212
00:20:37,772 --> 00:20:40,066
Quick! We can't let him get away!

213
00:20:47,866 --> 00:20:49,576
Up ahead! Up ahead!

214
00:20:50,452 --> 00:20:52,412
Fire! Fire, now!

215
00:21:01,046 --> 00:21:02,088
You missed me!

216
00:21:02,172 --> 00:21:04,216
Come to papa!

217
00:21:17,395 --> 00:21:18,772
Take that.

218
00:21:20,774 --> 00:21:22,442
How adorable.

219
00:21:23,693 --> 00:21:25,237
Got you in our sights!

220
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:28,281
Like taking candy from a...

221
00:21:28,365 --> 00:21:29,449
What?

222
00:21:30,909 --> 00:21:32,452
Hey, Gru!

223
00:21:32,536 --> 00:21:35,664
Try this on for size!

224
00:21:37,123 --> 00:21:39,834
That's weird. What is going...

225
00:21:44,589 --> 00:21:46,800
This is claustrophobic!

226
00:21:48,176 --> 00:21:49,594
No, no, no!

227
00:21:55,433 --> 00:21:57,852
Too small! This is too small for me!

228
00:22:04,234 --> 00:22:05,986
I hate that guy!

229
00:22:12,784 --> 00:22:16,830
...and please watch over us, and bless
that we'll have a good night's sleep.

230
00:22:16,913 --> 00:22:20,959
And bless that while we're sleeping,
no bugs will crawl into our ears

231
00:22:21,042 --> 00:22:23,295
and lay eggs in our brains.

232
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:26,298
Great. Thanks for that image, Edith.

233
00:22:26,923 --> 00:22:29,676
And please bless
that someone will adopt us soon,

234
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:32,679
and that the mommy and daddy will be nice

235
00:22:32,762 --> 00:22:34,681
and have a pet unicorn.

236
00:22:35,098 --> 00:22:36,308
Amen.

237
00:22:36,391 --> 00:22:38,143
- Amen.
- Amen.

238
00:22:42,981 --> 00:22:46,318
Unicorns, I love them
Unicorns, I love them

239
00:22:46,401 --> 00:22:50,113
Uni, uni, unicorns
I love them

240
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:53,825
Uni, unicorns, I could pet one

241
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:56,286
If they were really real

242
00:22:56,369 --> 00:22:57,495
And they are

243
00:22:57,579 --> 00:23:00,123
So, I bought one so I could pet it

244
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:03,418
Now it loves me
Now I love it

245
00:24:20,203 --> 00:24:22,581
Don't you... What the...

246
00:24:52,444 --> 00:24:54,279
Good luck, little girls!

247
00:24:59,451 --> 00:25:01,661
Whoa! Cool.

248
00:25:02,746 --> 00:25:06,791
Hi! We're orphans
from Miss Hattie's Home for Girls.

249
00:25:06,875 --> 00:25:08,793
- I don't care. Beat it!
- Come on!

250
00:25:08,919 --> 00:25:12,172
We're selling cookies
so, you know, we can have a better future.

251
00:25:12,255 --> 00:25:15,091
- Wait, wait! Do you have coco-nutties?
- Yeah.

252
00:25:37,239 --> 00:25:39,366
Light bulb.

253
00:25:42,452 --> 00:25:43,787
Dr Nefario!

254
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:47,123
I'm going to need a dozen tiny robots
disguised as cookies!

255
00:25:47,207 --> 00:25:49,167
- What?
- Cookie robots!

256
00:25:49,251 --> 00:25:51,670
- Who is this?
- Oh, forget it.

257
00:25:58,301 --> 00:26:01,096
Well, it appears you have cleared
our background check,

258
00:26:01,638 --> 00:26:03,390
Dr Gru.

259
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,812
And I see you have made a list

260
00:26:08,895 --> 00:26:12,649
of some of your personal achievements.

261
00:26:12,983 --> 00:26:15,527
Thank you for that. I love reading.

262
00:26:23,326 --> 00:26:25,787
And I see you have been given
the Medal of Honor

263
00:26:25,871 --> 00:26:27,998
and a knighthood.

264
00:26:30,375 --> 00:26:31,877
- Me, me, me.
- Me, me, me.

265
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,211
Kevin?

266
00:26:34,921 --> 00:26:37,048
You had your own cooking show

267
00:26:37,132 --> 00:26:41,052
and you can hold your breath
for 30 seconds?

268
00:26:41,136 --> 00:26:42,846
It's not that impressive.

269
00:26:45,098 --> 00:26:46,308
Idiot!

270
00:26:48,351 --> 00:26:51,146
- Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
- Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

271
00:26:53,064 --> 00:26:56,067
What in the name of... What?

272
00:26:56,651 --> 00:26:59,863
Well, here's the dealio.

273
00:26:59,946 --> 00:27:04,868
Things have been so lonely since my wife,

274
00:27:06,745 --> 00:27:09,247
Debbie, passed on.

275
00:27:09,331 --> 00:27:12,417
It's like my heart is a tooth,

276
00:27:13,084 --> 00:27:17,964
and it's got a cavity
that can only be filled with children.

277
00:27:18,381 --> 00:27:19,549
I'm sorry.

278
00:27:23,929 --> 00:27:27,098
You are a beautiful woman.
Do you speak Spanish?

279
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:30,018
Do I look like I speak Spanish?

280
00:27:31,895 --> 00:27:35,440
You have a face como un burro.

281
00:27:38,944 --> 00:27:41,446
Well, thank you!

282
00:27:42,948 --> 00:27:46,660
Anyway, can we proceed with this adoption?

283
00:27:46,743 --> 00:27:48,328
So, so excited!

284
00:27:50,247 --> 00:27:53,625
Please tell Margo, Edith and Agnes
to come to the lobby.

285
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:58,380
I bet the mom is beautiful!

286
00:27:58,463 --> 00:28:00,590
I bet the daddy's eyes sparkle.

287
00:28:00,674 --> 00:28:03,468
I bet their house is made of Gummi Bears.

288
00:28:04,469 --> 00:28:06,763
I'm just saying it'd be nice.

289
00:28:07,847 --> 00:28:11,142
My caterpillar never turned into a butterfly.

290
00:28:11,226 --> 00:28:12,852
That's a Cheeto.

291
00:28:15,981 --> 00:28:19,484
Well, Debbie was a very lucky woman.

292
00:28:21,903 --> 00:28:23,321
Who's Debbie?

293
00:28:23,405 --> 00:28:24,823
Your wife.

294
00:28:25,282 --> 00:28:26,783
Hi, girls!

295
00:28:36,835 --> 00:28:39,629
Girls, I want you to meet Mr Gru.

296
00:28:41,006 --> 00:28:43,049
He's going to adopt you.

297
00:28:43,133 --> 00:28:45,677
And he's a dentist!

298
00:28:48,013 --> 00:28:49,347
Yeah!

299
00:28:53,101 --> 00:28:57,480
Hi. I'm Margo. This is Edith.

300
00:28:58,023 --> 00:28:59,858
And that's Agnes.

301
00:28:59,941 --> 00:29:01,902
I got your leg, I got your leg!

302
00:29:01,985 --> 00:29:05,071
Okay, that is enough, little girl.

303
00:29:05,155 --> 00:29:07,490
- Let go of my leg. Come on. You can do it.
- Higher!

304
00:29:07,574 --> 00:29:09,868
- Higher!
- Just release your grip. Wow!

305
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:13,330
How do you remove them?
Is there a command?

306
00:29:13,413 --> 00:29:15,373
Some nonstick spray?

307
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,543
Crowbar?

308
00:29:20,337 --> 00:29:23,006
Okay, girls, let's go.

309
00:29:46,863 --> 00:29:48,281
Oh, yeah!

310
00:29:50,659 --> 00:29:52,661
Pretty impressive!

311
00:29:53,954 --> 00:29:55,914
What are you looking at?

312
00:29:55,997 --> 00:29:57,249
Boo-ya!

313
00:29:59,459 --> 00:30:01,461
You got shrunk, tiny mouthwash!

314
00:30:02,087 --> 00:30:03,129
Take that!

315
00:30:04,256 --> 00:30:06,049
You done been shrunk!

316
00:30:06,883 --> 00:30:08,093
Yello?

317
00:30:08,927 --> 00:30:10,929
I got the shrink ray, all right.

318
00:30:12,138 --> 00:30:14,641
No, I'm not playing with it.

319
00:30:14,724 --> 00:30:16,226
Gru?

320
00:30:18,019 --> 00:30:19,855
Don't make me laugh! No.

321
00:30:20,355 --> 00:30:22,899
P.S., he is not getting the moon,

322
00:30:22,983 --> 00:30:26,027
and P.P.S., by the time I'm done with him,

323
00:30:26,111 --> 00:30:27,654
he's gonna be begging for mercy.

324
00:30:29,739 --> 00:30:30,949
Okay, bye.

325
00:30:32,951 --> 00:30:37,038
Look at you, a little tiny toilet
for a little tiny baby...

326
00:30:38,456 --> 00:30:40,292
Curse you, tiny toilet!

327
00:30:44,963 --> 00:30:47,048
Okay, here we are.

328
00:30:47,132 --> 00:30:48,675
Home sweet home.

329
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:54,055
So, this is, like, your house?

330
00:30:54,848 --> 00:30:56,141
Wait a sec...

331
00:30:56,224 --> 00:30:58,977
You're the guy
who pretended he was a recorded message!

332
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:01,062
No, that was someone else.

333
00:31:14,618 --> 00:31:15,911
Can I hold your hand?

334
00:31:16,703 --> 00:31:17,746
No.

335
00:31:28,006 --> 00:31:32,886
When we got adopted by a bald guy,
I thought this'd be more like Annie.

336
00:31:41,811 --> 00:31:43,104
No, hey!

337
00:31:47,192 --> 00:31:50,362
Kyle, these are not treats. These are guests.

338
00:31:50,445 --> 00:31:53,073
Girls, this is Kyle, my

339
00:31:53,156 --> 00:31:54,199
dog.

340
00:31:57,035 --> 00:31:58,119
Fluffy doggy!

341
00:32:03,542 --> 00:32:04,709
What kind of dog is that?

342
00:32:04,793 --> 00:32:07,420
He is a... I don't know.

343
00:32:08,296 --> 00:32:11,508
Do you really think that this is
an appropriate place for little kids?

344
00:32:12,008 --> 00:32:13,677
'Cause it's not.

345
00:32:14,719 --> 00:32:17,097
No! No! Stay away from there!

346
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:18,723
It's fragile.

347
00:32:21,309 --> 00:32:24,771
Well, I suppose the plan will work with two.

348
00:32:24,855 --> 00:32:27,649
Hey! It's dark in here.

349
00:32:30,527 --> 00:32:32,863
It poked a hole in my juice box.

350
00:32:37,826 --> 00:32:39,077
As you can see,

351
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:42,664
I have provided everything
a child might need.

352
00:32:44,541 --> 00:32:45,625
All right.

353
00:32:46,751 --> 00:32:49,129
Okay. As I was saying... Hey!

354
00:32:50,338 --> 00:32:51,381
Somebody broke that.

355
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:55,510
Okay, okay.
Clearly, we need to set some rules.

356
00:32:55,594 --> 00:32:57,429
Rule number one.

357
00:32:57,512 --> 00:33:00,098
You will not touch anything.

358
00:33:00,181 --> 00:33:02,017
What about the floor?

359
00:33:02,434 --> 00:33:04,477
Yes, you may touch the floor.

360
00:33:04,561 --> 00:33:05,937
What about the air?

361
00:33:06,021 --> 00:33:08,106
Yes, you may touch the air!

362
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:09,232
What about this?

363
00:33:12,402 --> 00:33:14,362
- Where did you get that?
- Found it.

364
00:33:14,446 --> 00:33:18,241
Okay. Rule number two.
You will not bother me while I'm working.

365
00:33:18,325 --> 00:33:20,202
Rule number three.

366
00:33:20,285 --> 00:33:24,748
You will not cry or whine or laugh or giggle

367
00:33:25,081 --> 00:33:27,459
or sneeze or burp or fart!

368
00:33:28,126 --> 00:33:32,464
So, no, no, no annoying sounds. All right?

369
00:33:32,547 --> 00:33:34,799
Does this count as annoying?

370
00:33:38,136 --> 00:33:39,512
Very!

371
00:33:41,806 --> 00:33:44,392
I will see you in six hours.

372
00:33:46,478 --> 00:33:50,398
Okay, don't worry.
Everything's going to be fine.

373
00:33:51,024 --> 00:33:55,403
We're gonna be really happy here.
Right? Agnes?

374
00:34:23,974 --> 00:34:26,977
Question. What are these?

375
00:34:27,894 --> 00:34:30,939
A dozen boogie robots! Boogie!

376
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,484
Look at this. Watch me!

377
00:34:38,363 --> 00:34:41,032
Cookie robots. I said cookie robots.

378
00:34:41,616 --> 00:34:44,202
Why are you so old?

379
00:34:46,663 --> 00:34:48,373
Okay. I'm on it.

380
00:34:49,207 --> 00:34:50,542
Hello?

381
00:35:06,224 --> 00:35:07,475
TV!

382
00:35:27,329 --> 00:35:28,538
What is that?

383
00:35:28,747 --> 00:35:31,166
- Look at that!
- That is cool!

384
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,293
Come on!

385
00:35:33,793 --> 00:35:36,087
I don't think he's a dentist.

386
00:35:49,935 --> 00:35:51,770
We've been working on this for a while.

387
00:35:51,853 --> 00:35:54,606
It's a anti-gravity serum.

388
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,740
I meant to close that.
He'll be all right, I'm sure.

389
00:36:03,823 --> 00:36:06,868
- Do the effects wear off?
- So far

390
00:36:06,952 --> 00:36:08,954
no. No, they don't.

391
00:36:10,497 --> 00:36:13,583
And here, of course,
is the new weapon you ordered.

392
00:36:17,254 --> 00:36:18,296
No, no.

393
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:22,217
I said "dart gun," not... Okay.

394
00:36:22,801 --> 00:36:25,554
Oh, yes. 'Cause I was wondering

395
00:36:25,637 --> 00:36:28,265
under what circumstances
would we use this?

396
00:36:28,348 --> 00:36:29,808
But, anyway.

397
00:36:29,891 --> 00:36:33,311
What I really wanted to show you was this.

398
00:36:38,066 --> 00:36:41,194
Now those are cookie robots!

399
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,574
La, la, la, la
I love unicorns

400
00:36:45,657 --> 00:36:49,327
What are you doing here?
I told you to stay in the kitchen!

401
00:36:49,411 --> 00:36:52,080
We got bored. What is this place?

402
00:36:52,163 --> 00:36:53,915
Can I drink this?

403
00:36:53,999 --> 00:36:56,459
Do you want to explode?

404
00:36:58,086 --> 00:36:59,129
Gru!

405
00:36:59,212 --> 00:37:01,172
Get back in the kitchen!

406
00:37:01,256 --> 00:37:03,383
- Will you play with us?
- No.

407
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,011
- Why?
- Because I'm busy.

408
00:37:06,094 --> 00:37:07,679
Doing what?

409
00:37:09,097 --> 00:37:10,682
Okay, okay, you got me.

410
00:37:10,765 --> 00:37:13,518
The dentist thing is more of a hobby.

411
00:37:14,102 --> 00:37:16,521
In real life, I am a spy.

412
00:37:17,022 --> 00:37:20,192
And it is top secret,
and you may not tell anybody,

413
00:37:20,275 --> 00:37:22,360
- because if you do...
- What does this do?

414
00:37:26,239 --> 00:37:27,365
Hey!

415
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,659
My unicorn!

416
00:37:29,993 --> 00:37:31,661
You have to fix it.

417
00:37:31,745 --> 00:37:37,042
Fix it? Look, it has been disintegrated.
By definition, it cannot be fixed.

418
00:37:42,339 --> 00:37:44,507
That's freaking me out. What is she doing?

419
00:37:44,591 --> 00:37:47,761
She's gonna hold her breath
until she gets a new one.

420
00:37:49,137 --> 00:37:52,515
It is just a toy. Now stop it!

421
00:37:54,809 --> 00:37:56,937
Okay, okay! I'll fix it!

422
00:37:57,354 --> 00:37:59,314
Tim! Mark! Phil!

423
00:38:01,983 --> 00:38:03,235
This is very important.

424
00:38:03,318 --> 00:38:06,821
You have to get the little girl
a new unicorn toy.

425
00:38:12,869 --> 00:38:14,746
Hey, hey, hey! A toy!

426
00:38:15,914 --> 00:38:18,041
Go, and hurry!

427
00:38:18,124 --> 00:38:19,292
What are those?

428
00:38:19,376 --> 00:38:22,546
They are my cousins.

429
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:24,923
Jerry! Stuart!

430
00:38:26,007 --> 00:38:29,010
Watch them,
and keep them away from me, please.

431
00:38:46,278 --> 00:38:48,655
- Wow!
- Wow!

432
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:54,888
It was your cousin's idea.

433
00:39:55,222 --> 00:39:56,389
What?

434
00:39:56,765 --> 00:39:58,266
Okay, bedtime.

435
00:40:01,561 --> 00:40:03,021
Not you two!

436
00:40:04,564 --> 00:40:09,277
Okey-dokey. Beddie-bye.
All tucked in. Sweet dreams.

437
00:40:11,196 --> 00:40:13,031
Just so you know,

438
00:40:13,114 --> 00:40:15,075
you're never gonna be my dad.

439
00:40:15,659 --> 00:40:17,744
I think I can live with that.

440
00:40:19,412 --> 00:40:21,248
Are these beds made out of bombs?

441
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:25,961
Yes, but they are very old
and highly unlikely to blow up.

442
00:40:26,878 --> 00:40:28,922
But try not to toss and turn.

443
00:40:29,005 --> 00:40:30,131
Cool.

444
00:40:31,091 --> 00:40:34,261
- Will you read us a bedtime story?
- No.

445
00:40:34,344 --> 00:40:37,430
But we can't go to sleep
without a bedtime story.

446
00:40:37,514 --> 00:40:41,101
Well, then it's going to be
a long night for you, isn't it?

447
00:40:41,935 --> 00:40:45,564
So, good night, sleep tight,
and don't let the bed bugs bite.

448
00:40:45,647 --> 00:40:49,526
Because there are literally
thousands of them.

449
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:53,738
And there's probably
something in your closet.

450
00:40:55,323 --> 00:40:57,492
He's just kidding, Agnes.

451
00:41:19,723 --> 00:41:21,641
It's beautiful.

452
00:41:50,045 --> 00:41:52,505
Girls, let's go.

453
00:41:52,589 --> 00:41:55,425
Time to deliver the cookies!

454
00:41:56,384 --> 00:41:59,054
Okay. But first, we're going to dance class.

455
00:41:59,137 --> 00:42:02,057
Actually, we're going to have to skip
the dance class today.

456
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:06,686
Actually, we can't
skip the dance class today.

457
00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:08,772
We have a big recital coming up.

458
00:42:08,855 --> 00:42:12,108
- We're doing an excerpt from Swan Lake.
- Yeah, Swan Lake!

459
00:42:12,192 --> 00:42:13,944
That's fantastic. Wonderful.

460
00:42:14,027 --> 00:42:18,114
But we're going to deliver cookies! Come on!

461
00:42:20,283 --> 00:42:21,326
No.

462
00:42:22,202 --> 00:42:23,245
No?

463
00:42:23,328 --> 00:42:26,540
We're not going to deliver cookies
until we do dance class.

464
00:42:26,623 --> 00:42:27,749
Really?

465
00:42:27,832 --> 00:42:31,545
Well, I am not driving you to dance class.

466
00:42:31,628 --> 00:42:37,008
So if you want to go,
you are going to have to walk yourselves.

467
00:42:43,098 --> 00:42:44,391
What are you doing?

468
00:42:44,474 --> 00:42:46,226
Walking to dance class.

469
00:42:46,309 --> 00:42:48,270
Ya? Okay, fine.

470
00:42:48,353 --> 00:42:52,232
You iust keep walking,
because I'm really not driving you!

471
00:42:52,315 --> 00:42:53,525
Okay.

472
00:42:54,985 --> 00:42:57,487
You're going to suffer the wrath of Gru!

473
00:42:57,946 --> 00:42:59,990
Seriously, I'm going to count to three!

474
00:43:00,073 --> 00:43:02,033
And you had better be in this car!

475
00:43:02,117 --> 00:43:05,745
Here we go! One! Two!

476
00:43:05,829 --> 00:43:09,416
...three, four and five.

477
00:43:09,499 --> 00:43:12,419
And lift, and stretch.

478
00:43:12,502 --> 00:43:15,088
And one, and two...

479
00:43:15,171 --> 00:43:17,299
- Here you go.
- What is it?

480
00:43:17,382 --> 00:43:20,927
Your ticket to the dance recital.
You are coming, right?

481
00:43:21,011 --> 00:43:22,679
Of course, of course.

482
00:43:22,762 --> 00:43:25,849
I have pins and needles that I'm sitting on.

483
00:43:25,932 --> 00:43:27,809
Pinkie promise?

484
00:43:29,019 --> 00:43:32,230
Oh, yes. My pinkie promises.

485
00:43:45,410 --> 00:43:50,123
All right.
Our first customer is a man named Vector.

486
00:43:50,207 --> 00:43:51,958
But he's a V.

487
00:43:52,042 --> 00:43:54,002
You know, we're supposed
to start with the A's.

488
00:43:54,085 --> 00:43:56,004
Then we go to the B's. Then we...

489
00:43:56,087 --> 00:44:01,009
Yes, yes! I went to kindergarten.
I know how the alphabet works!

490
00:44:03,637 --> 00:44:06,306
I was just thinking

491
00:44:06,389 --> 00:44:10,143
that it might be nice
to deliver Mr Vector's first.

492
00:44:10,227 --> 00:44:11,853
That is all.

493
00:44:15,106 --> 00:44:17,651
Almost over. It's almost over.

494
00:44:19,736 --> 00:44:23,990
Girls, welcome back
to the fortress of Vector-tude!

495
00:44:24,991 --> 00:44:27,494
Do you have my cookies for me?

496
00:44:35,210 --> 00:44:37,170
Four boxes of mini-mints, two toffee totes,

497
00:44:37,254 --> 00:44:41,967
two caramel clumpies
and fifteen boxes of coco-nutties.

498
00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:45,637
Exactly. I'd like to see somebody else
order that many cookies.

499
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:46,805
Not likely.

500
00:44:46,888 --> 00:44:49,057
Name one person
who ordered more cookies than me.

501
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:50,684
That'll be $52.

502
00:44:51,268 --> 00:44:52,561
Right.

503
00:45:00,110 --> 00:45:02,863
Seven, eight, nine...

504
00:45:03,738 --> 00:45:06,324
Tic Tacs! Where was I?

505
00:45:06,408 --> 00:45:09,619
Seven, eight, nine...

506
00:45:09,703 --> 00:45:11,496
Why are you wearing pyjamas?

507
00:45:12,497 --> 00:45:15,876
These aren't pyiamas!
This is a warm-up suit.

508
00:45:32,559 --> 00:45:34,895
- What are you warming up for?
- Stuff.

509
00:45:34,978 --> 00:45:36,021
What sort of stuff?

510
00:45:36,104 --> 00:45:38,523
Super-cool stuff you wouldn't understand.

511
00:45:38,607 --> 00:45:40,025
Like sleeping?

512
00:45:40,108 --> 00:45:42,986
They are not pyjamas!

513
00:45:54,831 --> 00:45:58,043
Here you go, 52 big ones.

514
00:46:16,144 --> 00:46:17,604
Bye!

515
00:47:11,533 --> 00:47:12,909
Come on!

516
00:47:35,015 --> 00:47:36,808
What the...

517
00:47:39,644 --> 00:47:41,313
Quiet down, fish!

518
00:47:48,361 --> 00:47:49,446
Down, boy!

519
00:48:12,510 --> 00:48:15,847
We did it! Come on, girls, let's go!

520
00:48:23,730 --> 00:48:26,858
But what about the other people
who ordered cookies?

521
00:48:26,942 --> 00:48:29,653
Life is full of disappointments

522
00:48:29,736 --> 00:48:31,488
for some people.

523
00:48:37,202 --> 00:48:38,745
Don't do that!

524
00:48:38,828 --> 00:48:41,831
Super Silly Fun Land! Can we go? Please?

525
00:48:42,249 --> 00:48:43,333
No.

526
00:48:43,416 --> 00:48:45,919
But we've never been.
And it's the funnest place on earth!

527
00:48:46,002 --> 00:48:47,045
Don't care.

528
00:48:47,128 --> 00:48:48,255
- Please?
- Please?

529
00:48:48,338 --> 00:48:49,965
We'll never ask for anything else,
ever again!

530
00:48:50,048 --> 00:48:52,092
- Pretty please?
- Please?

531
00:48:59,266 --> 00:49:01,184
- Come on!
- Come on!

532
00:49:01,768 --> 00:49:04,062
Light bulb.

533
00:49:08,817 --> 00:49:10,610
Come on!

534
00:49:10,694 --> 00:49:13,655
Goodbye, have fun.

535
00:49:17,075 --> 00:49:20,620
Sorry, dude.
They can't ride without an adult.

536
00:49:20,704 --> 00:49:22,122
What?

537
00:50:18,845 --> 00:50:20,013
Oh, my gosh!

538
00:50:20,096 --> 00:50:22,516
Look at that fluffy unicorn!

539
00:50:25,268 --> 00:50:27,562
He's so fluffy, I'm gonna die!

540
00:50:27,646 --> 00:50:29,105
You've gotta let us play for it!

541
00:50:29,189 --> 00:50:30,899
No, no, no.

542
00:50:30,982 --> 00:50:32,275
Come on!

543
00:50:33,818 --> 00:50:36,363
How much for the fluffy unicorn?

544
00:50:37,572 --> 00:50:39,491
Well, it is not for sale.

545
00:50:39,574 --> 00:50:44,538
But all you gotta do to win it
is knock down that little spaceship there.

546
00:50:45,413 --> 00:50:46,540
It's easy!

547
00:50:54,923 --> 00:50:56,216
Yay!

548
00:51:08,186 --> 00:51:09,396
Again!

549
00:51:10,105 --> 00:51:12,566
- Wait!
- Come on. One more time!

550
00:51:12,649 --> 00:51:13,817
Just one more.

551
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:16,236
I accidentally closed my eyes.

552
00:51:31,585 --> 00:51:33,587
- I hit it! I hit it!
- That was cool.

553
00:51:38,049 --> 00:51:40,927
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What was that?

554
00:51:41,678 --> 00:51:44,764
She hit that. I saw that with my own eyes.

555
00:51:44,848 --> 00:51:47,601
Hey, buddy,
let me explain something to you.

556
00:51:47,684 --> 00:51:52,230
You see that little tin spaceship?
You see how it's not knocked over?

557
00:51:52,314 --> 00:51:55,150
Do you know what that means, professor?

558
00:51:55,233 --> 00:51:58,778
It means you don't get the unicorn!

559
00:52:00,906 --> 00:52:02,782
Somebody's got a frowny face.

560
00:52:02,866 --> 00:52:05,285
Boo! Better luck next time!

561
00:52:07,495 --> 00:52:10,207
Okay, my turn.

562
00:52:31,645 --> 00:52:34,147
Knocked over!

563
00:52:38,485 --> 00:52:41,404
- It's so fluffy!
- Yeah!

564
00:52:42,030 --> 00:52:44,157
That was awesome!

565
00:52:44,241 --> 00:52:45,867
You blew up the whole thing!

566
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:48,328
Let's go. Let's try another game!

567
00:52:55,377 --> 00:52:57,796
Gru, do you mind if I have a quick word?

568
00:52:58,547 --> 00:53:00,799
Okay, girls, go play.

569
00:53:08,348 --> 00:53:10,642
I got the shrink ray!

570
00:53:13,270 --> 00:53:15,480
Cotton candy!

571
00:53:16,481 --> 00:53:20,443
We have 12 days
until the moon is in optimum position.

572
00:53:20,527 --> 00:53:22,654
We can't afford any distractions!

573
00:53:24,406 --> 00:53:25,657
Get me Perkins.

574
00:53:33,707 --> 00:53:35,834
Sorry to bother you, Mr Perkins,

575
00:53:35,917 --> 00:53:39,880
but I figured that you would want to see this!

576
00:53:40,672 --> 00:53:41,798
What?

577
00:53:54,311 --> 00:53:56,813
Well done, Gru. Rather impressive.

578
00:53:56,897 --> 00:53:59,900
Now, the rest of the plan is simple.

579
00:54:00,525 --> 00:54:04,279
I fly to the moon. I shrink the moon.

580
00:54:04,362 --> 00:54:08,074
I grab the moon. I sit on the toilet.

581
00:54:08,158 --> 00:54:09,784
What?

582
00:54:09,868 --> 00:54:11,995
Sorry. Sorry!

583
00:54:12,078 --> 00:54:15,207
Could you excuse me for just one second?

584
00:54:15,290 --> 00:54:16,708
I told you not to touch my things.

585
00:54:16,791 --> 00:54:19,794
I told you, I told you.
I've told you a thousand times.

586
00:54:19,878 --> 00:54:21,588
Hey, can we order pizza?

587
00:54:21,671 --> 00:54:23,590
Pizza? You just had lunch.

588
00:54:23,673 --> 00:54:24,841
Not now, for dinner.

589
00:54:24,925 --> 00:54:26,468
Dinner?

590
00:54:26,551 --> 00:54:29,387
Just... Fine, fine, fine, whatever.
Just get back in there!

591
00:54:29,471 --> 00:54:31,264
Can we get stuffed crust?

592
00:54:32,516 --> 00:54:33,767
- Stuffed crust!
- Stuffed crust!

593
00:54:33,850 --> 00:54:35,435
I'll stuff you all in the crust!

594
00:54:37,437 --> 00:54:38,813
You're funny!

595
00:54:38,897 --> 00:54:41,650
Just don't come out of that room again!

596
00:54:42,192 --> 00:54:43,235
All right.

597
00:54:44,152 --> 00:54:47,572
Sorry about that. Where were we?

598
00:54:47,656 --> 00:54:49,241
You were sitting on the toilet.

599
00:54:49,324 --> 00:54:53,870
No, no, no! No, I'm sorry.
It was a little attempt at humour.

600
00:54:53,954 --> 00:54:56,748
I know how much you like to laugh

601
00:54:59,209 --> 00:55:03,046
inside. Now, I was saying...

602
00:55:06,633 --> 00:55:08,593
You don't seem terribly focused, Gru.

603
00:55:08,677 --> 00:55:11,054
Believe me, I am completely focused.

604
00:55:11,137 --> 00:55:13,139
- Hello!
- What?

605
00:55:13,223 --> 00:55:14,391
That guy is huge!

606
00:55:14,474 --> 00:55:15,892
- Are we on TV?
- What are those? Children?

607
00:55:15,976 --> 00:55:18,770
What are you doing?
I told you to stay out of here!

608
00:55:23,984 --> 00:55:25,235
No, no, no!

609
00:55:25,318 --> 00:55:26,361
Freeze ray!

610
00:55:26,444 --> 00:55:28,071
Mr Gru?

611
00:55:32,784 --> 00:55:34,119
Okay.

612
00:55:35,495 --> 00:55:36,872
As I was saying...

613
00:55:36,955 --> 00:55:40,792
No need to continue. I've seen quite enough.

614
00:55:40,876 --> 00:55:43,253
- But my plan...
- Is a great plan.

615
00:55:43,336 --> 00:55:46,506
I love everything about your plan,
except for one thing.

616
00:55:47,382 --> 00:55:48,717
You.

617
00:55:51,970 --> 00:55:55,557
Look, Mom, I drew a picture of me
landing on the moon!

618
00:55:58,643 --> 00:56:02,689
Look, Mom, I made a prototype of the rocket
out of macaroni!

619
00:56:05,317 --> 00:56:09,696
Look, Mom, I made a real rocket
based on the macaroni prototype!

620
00:56:20,957 --> 00:56:22,709
I don't understand.

621
00:56:23,043 --> 00:56:25,337
Let's face reality, Gru.

622
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:30,175
You've been at this for far too long
with Far too little success.

623
00:56:30,383 --> 00:56:34,596
We're gonna put our faith,
our money, into a...

624
00:56:35,430 --> 00:56:37,057
Well, a younger villain.

625
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:38,642
But I...

626
00:56:38,725 --> 00:56:40,810
It's over. Goodbye, Gru.

627
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:06,545
Now, I know there have been
some rumours going around

628
00:57:06,628 --> 00:57:09,923
that the bank is no longer funding us.

629
00:57:10,799 --> 00:57:13,593
Well, I am here to put those rumours to rest.

630
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:17,681
They are true.

631
00:57:19,599 --> 00:57:21,810
In terms of money,

632
00:57:22,978 --> 00:57:25,146
we have no money.

633
00:57:25,230 --> 00:57:27,816
So how will we get to the moon?

634
00:57:28,984 --> 00:57:30,819
The answer is clear.

635
00:57:30,902 --> 00:57:32,487
We won't.

636
00:57:35,532 --> 00:57:37,826
We are doomed.

637
00:57:39,077 --> 00:57:43,957
Now would probably be a good time
to look for other employment options.

638
00:57:45,584 --> 00:57:46,710
I know.

639
00:57:46,793 --> 00:57:52,007
I have fired up my resume
as I suggest that all of you do, as well.

640
00:57:53,008 --> 00:57:54,593
What is it?

641
00:57:56,511 --> 00:57:59,806
Can't you see that I am
in the middle of a pep talk?

642
00:58:29,461 --> 00:58:30,837
Yes!

643
00:58:30,921 --> 00:58:33,840
Yes, we will build our own rocket

644
00:58:34,466 --> 00:58:38,011
using this and whatever else we can find!

645
00:58:38,470 --> 00:58:42,098
Grab everything!
Hit the junkyards! Take apart the cars!

646
00:58:42,599 --> 00:58:44,476
Who needs the bank?

647
00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:46,311
Let's go. Let's go!

648
00:59:36,570 --> 00:59:38,572
Mom! What are you doing here?

649
00:59:38,655 --> 00:59:41,491
And here he is in the bathtub.

650
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:43,869
Look at his little buns.

651
00:59:46,204 --> 00:59:47,706
Mom.

652
00:59:47,789 --> 00:59:49,165
Not cool.

653
00:59:50,166 --> 00:59:54,713
And here, he's all dressed up
in his Sunday best.

654
00:59:55,380 --> 00:59:57,591
He looks like a girl!

655
00:59:57,674 --> 01:00:00,844
Yes, he does. An ugly girl!

656
01:00:23,658 --> 01:00:25,243
You're funny!

657
01:00:38,757 --> 01:00:41,718
Yes! Mine's shaped like a dead guy!

658
01:00:59,819 --> 01:01:02,364
Mr Perkins, your son is here.

659
01:01:02,447 --> 01:01:04,282
Send him in.

660
01:01:05,450 --> 01:01:07,118
Hey, Dad.

661
01:01:07,953 --> 01:01:09,412
You wanted to see me?

662
01:01:09,496 --> 01:01:12,457
- Yes, I did, Victor.
- I am not Victor any more.

663
01:01:12,541 --> 01:01:16,002
Victor was my nerd name. Now I am Vector!

664
01:01:16,086 --> 01:01:17,420
Sit down!

665
01:01:19,047 --> 01:01:21,466
Do you know where the shrink ray is?

666
01:01:21,883 --> 01:01:23,844
Duh! Back at my place.

667
01:01:23,927 --> 01:01:26,805
Oh, is that right?
Back at your place? That's cool.

668
01:01:26,888 --> 01:01:31,142
I guess Gru must iust have one
that looks exactly like it!

669
01:01:33,728 --> 01:01:36,982
What the... Those girls sold me cookies!

670
01:01:37,274 --> 01:01:41,027
Do you have any idea
how lucrative this moon heist could be?

671
01:01:41,111 --> 01:01:42,904
I give you the opportunity of a lifetime,

672
01:01:42,988 --> 01:01:44,823
and you just blow it!

673
01:01:45,699 --> 01:01:48,994
- No, I didn't.
- Oh, really?

674
01:01:49,411 --> 01:01:52,289
You iust wait
until Gru sees my latest weapon.

675
01:01:52,372 --> 01:01:55,375
Squid-launcher! Oh, yeah!

676
01:01:58,336 --> 01:02:00,505
There's a squid on my face!

677
01:02:02,048 --> 01:02:03,341
Don't worry.

678
01:02:03,425 --> 01:02:06,678
The moon is as good as ours.

679
01:02:09,514 --> 01:02:11,016
Come on now, it's bedtime.

680
01:02:11,099 --> 01:02:14,269
Did you brush your teeth?
Let me smell. Let me smell.

681
01:02:14,895 --> 01:02:16,271
You did not!

682
01:02:16,354 --> 01:02:20,442
Put on your PGs.
Hold still. Okay, seriously! Seriously!

683
01:02:20,525 --> 01:02:25,030
This is beddie-bye time, right now.
I'm not kidding around. I mean it!

684
01:02:25,113 --> 01:02:27,866
- But we're not tired!
- Well, I am tired.

685
01:02:27,949 --> 01:02:30,160
Will you read us a bedtime story?

686
01:02:34,039 --> 01:02:35,415
No.

687
01:02:35,498 --> 01:02:36,750
Pretty please!

688
01:02:36,833 --> 01:02:40,670
The physical appearance of the "please"
makes no difference.

689
01:02:40,754 --> 01:02:42,839
It is still no, so go to sleep.

690
01:02:42,923 --> 01:02:45,050
But we can't. We're all hyper!

691
01:02:45,133 --> 01:02:49,638
And without a bedtime story,
we'll just keep getting up and bugging you.

692
01:02:49,721 --> 01:02:50,805
All night long.

693
01:02:52,974 --> 01:02:54,226
Fine.

694
01:02:55,268 --> 01:02:58,271
All right, all right. Sleepy Kittens.

695
01:02:58,730 --> 01:03:00,065
Sleepy Kittens?

696
01:03:00,482 --> 01:03:01,900
- What are these?
- Puppets.

697
01:03:02,359 --> 01:03:04,653
You use them when you tell the story.

698
01:03:11,743 --> 01:03:14,287
Okay, let's get this over with.

699
01:03:14,788 --> 01:03:19,042
"Three little kittens loved to play,
they had fun in the sun all day.

700
01:03:19,125 --> 01:03:23,547
"Then their mother came out and said,
'Time for kittens to go to bed."'

701
01:03:23,630 --> 01:03:27,509
Wow! This is garbage.
You actually like this?

702
01:03:27,592 --> 01:03:29,052
Keep reading!

703
01:03:29,845 --> 01:03:32,222
- Come on!
- All right, all right, all right.

704
01:03:32,305 --> 01:03:34,891
"Three little kittens started to bawl,

705
01:03:34,975 --> 01:03:37,310
"'Mommy, we're not tired at all#

706
01:03:37,394 --> 01:03:39,938
"Their mother smiled and said with a purr,

707
01:03:40,021 --> 01:03:43,692
"'Fine, but at least
you should brush your fur."'

708
01:03:43,775 --> 01:03:45,944
Now you brush the fur.

709
01:03:47,654 --> 01:03:49,406
This is literature?

710
01:03:49,489 --> 01:03:52,742
A 2-year-old could have written this.
All right.

711
01:03:53,285 --> 01:03:56,288
"Three little kittens with fur all brushed

712
01:03:56,371 --> 01:03:59,791
"said, 'We can't sleep, we feel too rushed! '

713
01:03:59,875 --> 01:04:02,961
"Their mother replied, with a voice like silk,

714
01:04:03,044 --> 01:04:05,964
"'Fine, but at least
you should drink your milk."'

715
01:04:06,047 --> 01:04:08,383
Now make them drink the milk.

716
01:04:12,721 --> 01:04:16,600
I don't like this book.
This is going on forever.

717
01:04:16,683 --> 01:04:23,023
"Three little kittens, with milk all gone,
rubbed their eyes and started to yawn.

718
01:04:29,404 --> 01:04:35,202
"'We can't sleep, we can't even try'
Then their mother sang a lullaby.

719
01:04:35,285 --> 01:04:41,041
"'Good night kittens, close your eyes.
Sleep in peace until you rise.

720
01:04:41,625 --> 01:04:44,836
"'Though while you sleep, we are apart,

721
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:49,674
"'your mommy loves you with all her heart."'

722
01:04:53,678 --> 01:04:56,014
The end. Okay, good night.

723
01:04:57,015 --> 01:04:59,267
- Wait!
- What?

724
01:04:59,351 --> 01:05:01,228
What about good night kisses?

725
01:05:03,188 --> 01:05:06,942
No, no. There will be no kissing or hugging
or kissing.

726
01:05:09,861 --> 01:05:12,447
He is not gonna kiss us good night, Agnes.

727
01:05:13,073 --> 01:05:15,116
I like him. He's nice.

728
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:16,535
But scary.

729
01:05:17,786 --> 01:05:19,079
Like Santa!

730
01:05:37,597 --> 01:05:41,810
Only 48 hours till the launch,
and all systems are go.

731
01:05:44,062 --> 01:05:45,730
About that,

732
01:05:46,231 --> 01:05:50,485
I was thinking that maybe
we could move the date of the heist.

733
01:05:50,569 --> 01:05:56,157
Please tell me this is not as a result
of the girls' dance recital, is it?

734
01:05:56,241 --> 01:05:58,451
No, no, no!

735
01:05:58,535 --> 01:06:01,580
The recital? Don't... That's stupid!

736
01:06:01,705 --> 01:06:06,585
I iust think it's kind of weird
to do it on a Saturday.

737
01:06:06,668 --> 01:06:12,257
I was thinking,
maybe a heist is a Tuesday thing, right?

738
01:06:12,966 --> 01:06:16,595
Gru, you and I have been
working on this for years.

739
01:06:16,678 --> 01:06:18,763
It's everything we've dreamed of.

740
01:06:18,847 --> 01:06:20,765
Your chance to make history,

741
01:06:20,849 --> 01:06:24,060
become the man who stole the moon!

742
01:06:24,144 --> 01:06:27,939
But these girls
are becoming a major distraction!

743
01:06:28,023 --> 01:06:29,357
They need to go.

744
01:06:30,108 --> 01:06:34,112
If you don't do something about it,
then I will.

745
01:06:35,780 --> 01:06:37,449
I understand.

746
01:06:39,951 --> 01:06:41,453
Good.

747
01:06:44,581 --> 01:06:45,749
Butt.

748
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:50,170
Butt.

749
01:07:02,724 --> 01:07:03,892
Butt.

750
01:07:05,769 --> 01:07:09,523
All right.
Now, when we put our cups together,

751
01:07:09,606 --> 01:07:12,275
we will make the "clink" sound
with our mouths.

752
01:07:12,359 --> 01:07:13,527
Ready? Edith?

753
01:07:13,610 --> 01:07:14,653
- Clink.
- Clink.

754
01:07:14,736 --> 01:07:16,738
There we go. And now we drink.

755
01:07:17,489 --> 01:07:18,532
And Agnes?

756
01:07:18,615 --> 01:07:19,699
- Clink.
- Clink.

757
01:07:19,783 --> 01:07:21,159
Very good!

758
01:07:22,869 --> 01:07:24,246
Excuse me, girls.

759
01:07:24,621 --> 01:07:25,747
Come on!

760
01:07:25,830 --> 01:07:29,376
Don't worry, I'll be back. Keep clinking.

761
01:07:29,834 --> 01:07:30,961
- Clink, clink.
- Clink, clink.

762
01:07:33,338 --> 01:07:35,215
Miss Hattie, what are you doing here?

763
01:07:35,298 --> 01:07:39,219
I'm here for the girls. I received a call
that you wanted to return them.

764
01:07:41,805 --> 01:07:46,059
And also,
I did purchase a Spanish dictionary.

765
01:07:49,479 --> 01:07:50,689
I didn't like what you said.

766
01:07:50,772 --> 01:07:52,148
But...

767
01:07:58,446 --> 01:08:01,032
I will get the girls ready.

768
01:08:10,917 --> 01:08:13,378
Don't let her take us, Mr Gru!

769
01:08:14,629 --> 01:08:16,506
Tell her you wanna keep us.

770
01:08:16,590 --> 01:08:18,592
All right, girls. Come on, let's go.

771
01:08:18,675 --> 01:08:21,178
Goodbye, Mr Gru. Thanks for everything.

772
01:08:37,277 --> 01:08:39,362
I did it for your own good.

773
01:08:39,738 --> 01:08:42,824
Come on, let's go get that moon.

774
01:08:44,659 --> 01:08:45,744
Right.

775
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:03,446
What is this for?

776
01:10:05,115 --> 01:10:06,408
The recital?

777
01:10:06,491 --> 01:10:09,744
I am the greatest criminal mind
of the century.

778
01:10:09,828 --> 01:10:13,915
I don't go to little girls' dance recitals!

779
01:10:34,728 --> 01:10:39,691
Opening launch bay doors.
Commencing launch sequence.

780
01:10:39,774 --> 01:10:44,779
And we are good to go
in T minus 10 seconds.

781
01:10:45,864 --> 01:10:50,327
Ten, nine, eight, seven,

782
01:10:50,410 --> 01:10:51,453
six...

783
01:11:17,521 --> 01:11:18,772
Oh, yeah!

784
01:11:20,732 --> 01:11:23,276
Nice work, Doctor. All systems go.

785
01:11:23,693 --> 01:11:24,778
Boo-ya!

786
01:11:36,039 --> 01:11:37,624
My flight suit.

787
01:11:39,376 --> 01:11:42,546
Oh, yeah! Once again, the mighty...

788
01:13:07,380 --> 01:13:09,090
I've got it!

789
01:13:10,592 --> 01:13:13,428
I've got the moon!

790
01:13:13,512 --> 01:13:16,306
I've got the moon!

791
01:13:31,404 --> 01:13:32,906
I can make it!

792
01:13:40,163 --> 01:13:42,499
- Wait a minute!
- Kevin!

793
01:13:45,627 --> 01:13:47,212
Come on, come on!

794
01:13:55,470 --> 01:13:57,055
He's still not here.

795
01:13:57,138 --> 01:13:59,558
Why would he come? He gave us up.

796
01:13:59,641 --> 01:14:01,184
But he pinkie promised!

797
01:14:01,268 --> 01:14:04,020
Girls, girls, places!

798
01:14:04,104 --> 01:14:06,898
No, we can't start yet!
We're still expecting someone.

799
01:14:06,982 --> 01:14:09,359
Can we just wait a few more minutes?

800
01:14:13,196 --> 01:14:15,615
All right. But just a few more minutes.

801
01:14:15,699 --> 01:14:17,784
He's not coming, guys.

802
01:14:21,246 --> 01:14:23,248
Gru! Gru, can you hear me?

803
01:14:25,584 --> 01:14:29,129
Quick, we have to warn him, and fast!

804
01:15:04,122 --> 01:15:06,124
Okay, okay. There's the library.

805
01:15:06,208 --> 01:15:08,919
That's Third Street. The dance studio...

806
01:15:09,002 --> 01:15:10,420
There! There! There it is!

807
01:15:47,874 --> 01:15:50,293
Sorry, buddy. Show's over.

808
01:15:50,627 --> 01:15:52,254
Over?

809
01:16:30,208 --> 01:16:31,710
Vector, open up!

810
01:16:33,461 --> 01:16:35,964
First give me the moon. Then we'll talk.

811
01:16:49,519 --> 01:16:52,022
- Mr Gru!
- Lip it, Happy Meal.

812
01:16:52,105 --> 01:16:53,607
Now, the girls.

813
01:16:53,690 --> 01:16:58,069
Actually, I think I'll hold on to them
a little while longer.

814
01:16:58,153 --> 01:16:59,196
No!

815
01:16:59,279 --> 01:17:01,948
Oh, yeah! Unpredictable!

816
01:17:02,657 --> 01:17:04,159
Listen close, you little punk.

817
01:17:04,242 --> 01:17:07,579
When I get in there,
you are in for a world of pain!

818
01:17:08,872 --> 01:17:10,707
I'm really scared!

819
01:17:14,169 --> 01:17:16,004
He is gonna kick your butt.

820
01:17:56,294 --> 01:17:58,171
What? He punched my shark!

821
01:18:24,906 --> 01:18:26,032
There he is!

822
01:18:31,955 --> 01:18:33,206
Hang on, Gru.

823
01:18:38,545 --> 01:18:39,838
Oh, no!

824
01:18:50,140 --> 01:18:51,975
Vector has the girls. Go!

825
01:18:55,979 --> 01:18:57,647
What happened to the ship? It's big again!

826
01:18:57,731 --> 01:19:00,483
- Not as big as the moon is going to be!
- What?

827
01:19:00,567 --> 01:19:05,655
The larger the mass of an obiect, the quicker
the effects of the shrink ray wear off!

828
01:19:05,739 --> 01:19:08,658
I call it the Nefario Principle.

829
01:19:08,742 --> 01:19:10,660
I just came up with it now, actually.

830
01:19:11,494 --> 01:19:12,996
Oh, no!

831
01:19:19,044 --> 01:19:20,378
Did you see that?

832
01:19:20,504 --> 01:19:23,215
- Vector! Help!
- Vector!

833
01:19:23,298 --> 01:19:24,508
- Over here!
- Hey!

834
01:19:24,591 --> 01:19:26,218
What are you girls doing back there?

835
01:19:26,301 --> 01:19:27,344
The moon!

836
01:19:43,485 --> 01:19:44,528
Watch out!

837
01:19:48,365 --> 01:19:50,158
Get as close in as you can.

838
01:19:50,992 --> 01:19:52,285
You got it.

839
01:20:08,635 --> 01:20:10,846
- Mr Gru, up here!
- Mr Gru!

840
01:20:10,929 --> 01:20:12,973
Okay, girls! Girls!

841
01:20:13,056 --> 01:20:15,767
- You're going to have to iump.
- Jump?

842
01:20:15,851 --> 01:20:17,769
Are you insane?

843
01:20:17,853 --> 01:20:19,271
Don't worry, I will catch you.

844
01:20:20,188 --> 01:20:21,606
You gave us back!

845
01:20:21,690 --> 01:20:25,861
I know, I know.
And it is the worst mistake I ever made.

846
01:20:26,444 --> 01:20:28,363
But you have to jump now.

847
01:20:28,947 --> 01:20:31,032
It'll be okay.

848
01:20:35,996 --> 01:20:37,038
Okay, girls.

849
01:20:39,124 --> 01:20:40,625
Jump now!

850
01:20:45,630 --> 01:20:47,924
Margo, I will catch you.

851
01:20:48,592 --> 01:20:51,636
And I will never let you go again.

852
01:21:01,229 --> 01:21:03,273
- Not so fast!
- No!

853
01:21:03,356 --> 01:21:04,608
Let me go!

854
01:21:08,570 --> 01:21:09,654
Margo!

855
01:21:15,452 --> 01:21:17,662
I'm coming, Margo. Hang on!

856
01:21:46,608 --> 01:21:48,109
I got you.

857
01:22:06,253 --> 01:22:07,379
No!

858
01:22:24,563 --> 01:22:25,814
Oh, poop.

859
01:22:26,898 --> 01:22:28,733
This time, good triumphs,

860
01:22:28,817 --> 01:22:31,945
and the moon has been returned
to its rightful place in the sky.

861
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:36,950
But once again, law enforcement is baffled,
leaving everyone to wonder,

862
01:22:37,033 --> 01:22:38,827
who is this mysterious hero?

863
01:22:38,910 --> 01:22:40,871
And what will he do next?

864
01:22:41,413 --> 01:22:43,206
Okay, girls. Time for bed.

865
01:22:43,290 --> 01:22:47,002
- Come on! We want a story.
- Three sleepy kittens!

866
01:22:47,085 --> 01:22:51,339
Oh, no! Sorry. That book was
accidentally destroyed maliciously.

867
01:22:52,757 --> 01:22:55,969
Tonight we are going to read a new book.

868
01:22:56,052 --> 01:22:58,263
This one is called

869
01:22:58,346 --> 01:23:02,017
One Big Unicorn by... Who wrote this?

870
01:23:02,809 --> 01:23:06,521
Me! I wrote it. Look, it's a puppet book!

871
01:23:07,314 --> 01:23:09,024
Here, watch this.

872
01:23:10,192 --> 01:23:12,027
That's the horn!

873
01:23:16,031 --> 01:23:18,116
This is gonna be the best book ever!

874
01:23:18,200 --> 01:23:22,996
Not to pat myself on the back,
but, yes, it probably will be.

875
01:23:23,079 --> 01:23:24,164
Here we go.

876
01:23:24,247 --> 01:23:27,250
"One big unicorn, strong and free

877
01:23:27,334 --> 01:23:30,045
"thought he was happy as he could be.

878
01:23:31,379 --> 01:23:34,841
"Then three little kittens came around

879
01:23:35,175 --> 01:23:38,929
"and turned his whole life upside down."

880
01:23:39,012 --> 01:23:40,764
Hey, that one looks like me!

881
01:23:40,847 --> 01:23:42,974
No, what are you talking about?
These are kittens!

882
01:23:43,058 --> 01:23:46,811
Any relation to persons living or dead
is completely coincidental.

883
01:23:50,357 --> 01:23:52,734
"They made him laugh.

884
01:23:52,817 --> 01:23:55,028
"They made him cry.

885
01:23:57,280 --> 01:23:59,741
"He never should have said goodbye.

886
01:24:00,575 --> 01:24:05,163
"And now he knows he could never part

887
01:24:05,247 --> 01:24:07,833
"from those three little kittens

888
01:24:08,333 --> 01:24:11,253
"that changed his heart.

889
01:24:11,336 --> 01:24:13,421
"The end."

890
01:24:13,505 --> 01:24:15,841
Okay, all right. Good night.

891
01:24:39,155 --> 01:24:40,782
I love you.

892
01:24:41,324 --> 01:24:43,034
I love you, too.

893
01:24:52,377 --> 01:24:54,212
No, no!

894
01:24:56,423 --> 01:24:57,549
All right.

895
01:25:02,554 --> 01:25:04,723
Didn't I get you already?

896
01:25:38,548 --> 01:25:40,550
They're very good!

897
01:25:40,634 --> 01:25:43,595
I'm so proud of you, Son.

898
01:25:43,678 --> 01:25:46,598
You've turned out to be a great parent!

899
01:25:47,724 --> 01:25:49,226
Just like me.

900
01:25:49,809 --> 01:25:52,062
Maybe even better.

901
01:26:19,381 --> 01:26:21,091
No, I'm fine. Go ahead.

902
01:26:22,843 --> 01:26:24,302
No, no, no!

903
01:28:03,944 --> 01:28:05,529
Hey, Carl! Hey.

904
01:28:09,783 --> 01:28:10,867
No, no, no.

905
01:28:10,951 --> 01:28:12,160
Me, me, me.

906
01:28:13,495 --> 01:28:14,538
John?

907
01:28:14,621 --> 01:28:16,081
No, no. Me, me, me.

908
01:28:39,813 --> 01:28:40,856
Oh, poop.

909
01:29:27,569 --> 01:29:28,778
Oh, no!

910
01:29:29,613 --> 01:29:31,072
Stop! Stop!

911
01:30:32,300 --> 01:30:33,677
Hello, I am Gru.

912
01:30:33,760 --> 01:30:36,763
Back to work, back to work! Back to...
